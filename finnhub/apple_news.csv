Phil Schiller, previously Apple’s head of marketing, has overseen the division since that time. He remains in charge of the App Store.Prior to Cisco, Low held the top communications job at Dell Technologies Inc. She has worked in the industry for 30 years, according to her executive profile at Cisco. Her hiring by Apple was earlier reported by BuzzFeed News.Low joins Apple as the iPhone maker is facing criticism from developers over App Store practices and greater scrutiny from regulators. The company has key events ahead including its June conference for software developers.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=042a9433999fc13b070f89b23f03d45456c71c9d131c410c15a43deb66d41ed1

Users will begin seeing the safety section in Google Play sometime in the first three months of 2022.The transparency push echoes rival Apple Inc.’s decision in 2020 to compel app-makers to disclose what information they gather, and what they do with it. Apple’s latest mobile software update, iOS 14.5, includes an App Tracking Transparency feature, which requires users to opt in to being tracked by apps for personalized advertising. Developers expect to lose revenue from this change because most consumers won’t agree to have their data collected.Google, which itself is dependent on advertising revenue, has taken a more measured approach. The internet search giant is discussing how it can limit data collection and cross-app tracking on the Android operating system in a way that is less stringent than Apple’s solution, Bloomberg has reported.The Google Play safety section will also tell users if an app encrypts data, if it follows Google’s policies for families and children, whether users have a choice in sharing information, and whether users can request data deletion if they uninstall an app.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=cd1f0550983193d5ea8da3211e4211e8aaa0a29a494c42f136c3d2625bbb4f63

Trystan Kosmynka, a senior director at Apple in charge of the app review process, is set to be called to the stand later in the day.Despite having a tenure with Apple of almost 20 years and being in charge of a business that’s estimated to generate more than $20 billion in revenue a year, Fischer keeps a low profile: He’s not featured on Apple’s website, he doesn’t appear at Apple product launch events and he rarely speaks publicly. He reports to Phil Schiller, the company’s top App Store executive, who is expected to be called as a witness later in the trial, along with Chief Executive Tim Cook.Topics Fischer may be questioned about by Epic’s lawyers include App Store business strategy, finances, policies and practices, and market power over iOS devices, according to court filings. Kosmynka, who reports to Apple’s developer relations chief, will be asked about the app review process and App Store curation.How Apple’s App Store Sparked an Epic Trial: QuickTakeThe trial in Oakland, California, comes as Apple faces a backlash -- with billions of dollars in revenue on the line -- from global regulators and some app developers who say its standard App Store fee of 30% and others policies are unjust and self-serving.The fight with Epic blew up in August when the game maker told customers it would replace Apple’s in-app purchase system with its own, circumventing Apple’s commissions from add-ons inside of Fortnite. Apple then removed the game, cutting off access for more than a billion customers.Apple, which vehemently denies abusing its market power, has called Epic’s legal gambit a “fundamental assault” on a business model that is beneficial to both developers and consumers.In the first three days of the trial, Epic put on testimony by its CEO, Tim Sweeney, and other executives at the game maker to make the case that the App Store is a like a “walled garden” that has left users and developers “trapped” in an anticompetitive marketplace.Microsoft to Judge: Apple’s Rules Blocked Our Gaming Service TooEpic has also called as witnesses executives from other companies with gaming businesses, including Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp., to show that they, too, have been constrained by onerous App Store rules.Apple has its used its cross-examination of witnesses to try to undercut their credibility and poke holes in Epic’s antitrust claims.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=734a81906d98a278cc82e4e02056b017212762cdaaef7674d61c1fb54fb9e36b

In the latest move, Apple is bringing ads to the store’s search tab which will show up above the suggested apps list. “With Search tab ads, you can capture the attention of these customers before they search,” Apple wrote in a press release.Millions of people visit Apple Store each day in search of their next app. Apple wants developers to take advantage of the extra ad space to increase their exposure to potential customers.The difference is that while search result ads require keywords, this is not needed when placing search tab ads in the App Store. Instead, search tab ads are automatically generated using materials on the advertiser’s App Store product page. These new ads will show the app name, icon, and subtitle. Apple is maintaining its existing App Store ads budget and pricing model in the added slot. For example, advertisers will still be able to spend as much or as little as they want since there is no minimum spend requirement. Moreover, they will be free to stop or change their campaigns at any time.

173,company,1620273660,Chip Shortage Forces Carmakers to Leave Out Some High-End Features,67610210,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v9NcU3E_LE6YeZzPPIG1dg--~B/aD03Mjg7dz0xMjk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/5cee25afef089eba1219f2327f155c55,AAPL,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- When automakers were first hit with chip shortages at the end of last year, they tried idling factories until the troubles blew over. But with the crisis stretching into its fifth month and getting worse, they’re getting creative to keep at least some production moving forward.Nissan is leaving navigation systems out of thousands of vehicles that typically would have them because of the shortages. Ram no longer offers its 1500 pickups with a standard “intelligent” rearview mirror that monitors for blind spots. Renault has stopped offering an oversized digital screen behind the steering wheel on its Arkana SUV -- also to save on chips.The crisis is an historic test for the century-old auto industry just as it is trying to accelerate a shift toward smarter, electric vehicles. For decades, carmakers moved steadily to include more and better advanced features; now, they’re stripping some of them out -- at least temporarily -- to salvage their sales.That rollback underscores the depth of the issues facing the industry. Just last week, BMW AG, Honda Motor Co. and Ford Motor Co. all flagged worsening problems from chip shortages. A failure to secure critical supplies is a massive short-term setback -- millions of vehicle sales will be lost this year -- and bodes ill for the future as competition from tech-savvy internet and consumer-electronics companies intensifies.“This probably gets worse before it gets better,” said Stacy Rasgon, who covers the semiconductor industry for Sanford C. Bernstein. “It just takes a long time to bring this capacity online.”NXP Semiconductor NV Chief Executive Officer Kurt Sievers said the shift to electric vehicles is happening faster than anticipated, which has added to the increased demand for automotive chips. NXP plans to ship at least 20% more auto chips by revenue in the first half of 2021 compared with the first half of 2019, even though car production has dropped about 10% over the period, he said.Mark Liu, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., cautioned the crisis is far from over. His company, which is the world’s most advanced chipmaker and will be critical to any resolution, will begin to meet auto clients’ minimum requirements by June, but expects the car-chip shortages could last until early 2022, he said in an interview with CBS.Automakers can’t just wait. One reaction to the shortage is to allocate the scarce components to more profitable and better-selling vehicles at the expense of other models -- something manufacturers like France’s Renault SA and Japan’s Nissan Motor Co. are doing.Carmakers are also building vehicles with less technology. Peugeot is going back to old-fashioned analog speedometers for its 308 hatchbacks, rather than use digital versions that need hard-to-find chips. General Motors Co. said it built some Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks without a certain fuel-economy module, costing drivers about 1 mile per gallon. Nissan is cutting the number of vehicles with pre-installed navigation systems by about a third, according to a person familiar with the matter.Why Can’t We Just Make More Chips?The Japanese manufacturer, which in early January became one of the first automakers to warn of an impending shortage, is also prioritizing chip supply to the two best-selling models in each major market, the person said. In one instance, Nissan flew chip supplies from India to the U.S. on a chartered cargo flight to help production move forward there. A representative for Nissan declined to comment.Buyers of Renault’s sporty Arkana now have to settle for a smaller display without a navigation map, and forgo an option for a phone charger by induction.Stellantis NV -- formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group -- has modified the Ram 1500 pickup so that the digital rearview mirror that usually comes standard is now available only as an upgrade option, according to a person familiar with the matter. The manufacturer is also using parts that don’t require chips from its more basic Ram Classic truck to keep the pricier version moving down the assembly line.“Given the fluid nature of this complex issue, Stellantis employees across the enterprise are finding creative solutions every day to minimize the impact to our vehicles so we can build the most in-demand products as possible,” spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said in an email.The car industry’s predicament dates back to poor planning during the pandemic and limited chipmaking capacity, but it’s been compounded by shrinking available cargo space as the global economy recovers from Covid-19. When automakers can secure orders, their chips often can’t ship.That bottleneck is compounded by the fact that major car-chip makers NXP, Infineon Technologies AG and Renesas Electronics Corp. account for just 40% of supply, with the remaining 60% split between tens of thousands of smaller designers. Those smaller players often lack the influence to get their chips manufactured at foundries when capacity is tight.In at least one case, carmakers are asking a major chipmaker to send microcontrollers that don’t meet standard specifications, a person familiar with the matter said. Those sub-standard chips wouldn’t jeopardize safety essentials, like brakes, the person said, but they could mean in-car entertainment or emissions monitoring systems are more likely to malfunction in extreme weather.Automakers and suppliers can accept whatever chips are available and rewrite the software to give them a new task, said Sig Huber, a consultant at Conway MacKenzie and a former head of purchasing at Fiat Chrysler. Tesla Inc. said last week it alleviated issues by reaching out to new semiconductor suppliers and then quickly writing new firmware for those chips.Stellantis is working on more standardization across its vehicle lineup rather than having to use specific chips for some models, Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer said on an call with reporters this week.“More standardization and flexibility, which is key when we have supply constraints,” he said. “We’re managing scarcity.”Manufacturers are also stocking incomplete cars, or “building shy” in industry parlance, to keep production lines humming. In Hamtramck, greater Detroit, an area stretching several blocks is filled with Ford F-150 pickup trucks sans some chips. General Motors said it is also storing unfinished vehicles while awaiting semiconductors.Meanwhile, behind the scenes, car suppliers are going to unusual lengths to try to secure chips. A Stellantis partner called JVIS-USA LLC tried to sue NXP in a Michigan court in April in a Hail Mary attempt to get more chips, but a judge rejected its request. Automotive supplier Visteon Corp. flagged that carmakers may seek compensation because of the shortages. In Japan, Toyota Motor Corp. President Akio Toyoda visited a Renesas plant that had suffered a fire to hasten its return to production.Yet no relief is in sight, with even Apple Inc., whose high-specification iPhones and aggressive demands typically place it at the front of the chip-customer line, saying last week it’s starting to feel the pinch. That may leave carmakers wanting even when chip manufacturers eventually manage to increase capacity.“This has the potential to be a longer-term issue,” said Anna-Marie Baisden, an automotive analyst at Fitch Solutions. “This will only be exacerbated as vehicles become technologically advanced and use more chips.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f68bd0a2c9421b24b83261c9b8ffe6f5d6a3a59e94f8f0ac66915464728b9794

Identifying what is working is critical — to do more of it. So, to lead by example, each Tuesday, you’ll get a trade from my trading journal, in which I explain my thought process from start to finish. Trading is all about finding something that works, and applying it over and over again. That’s how you find trading success. So study up on this “Tuesday Trade” and let’s get to work. For this “Tuesday Trade” I want to talk to you about my earnings trade in Apple (NASDAQ: APPL). Apple is a huge player when it comes to the market, especially during the heart of earnings season, as it is a part of the FAANG reports — Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Their earnings report was set for April 28, so on the day before the release, I decided I wanted a piece of the action. Choosing My Setup... Recently, the market has been struggling to run in one direction, and conditions have been very choppy so I knew buying a butterfly was not wise. Instead, I chose to go with an iron condor. Why? Because iron condors do not require you to pick a direction. Instead, you just have to determine a range in which a stock will move, and if it stays within that range you can profit off trading the report. Defining Range For Gain On the morning of April 28, I sold four iron condors in AAPL for 135/140/135/130 CALL/PUT @3.75 Limit Orders (LMT). Pictured below using my Hot Zone Indicator, you can see that while it had moved up to $6.69 or 7% on earnings, on average it sees a 1-4% move. I was anticipating APPL was going to stay around 135, and if it did so, I could buy back the iron condor for less than I sold it for. My target was around $2.00. Payoff After The Report... Apple’s report was released, and though its stock price fluctuated, it stayed within our range so I decided to take profits on half of my positions. I bought back two out of the four iron condors for 135/140/135/130 CALL/PUT @2.30 LMT. Historically speaking, the first week of May is weak. That, combined with the “FAANGover” — or the pullback after FAANG earnings — gave me a reason to be slightly bearish. So even though I let my final two iron condors sit for a little bit longer, I was keeping a very close eye on them. Just one hour later I decided to buy back the rest of my iron condors for 135/140/135/130 CALL/PUT @2.28 LMT. I figured it would be better to take the profits rather than wait any longer because I knew I was going to get rid of the rest of that position by the end of the day. This was an earnings report trade, so unlike some of my “run into earnings” trades, the time I held these was significantly shorter. This was a two-day trade, rather than a trade over a few weeks. It is also important to note that trading the earning reports is inherently riskier, as they are often an all-or-nothing type of trade, depending on the results of the earnings itself.

In the world of DeFi, tokens such as Force DAO and Tierion surged more than 1,000% on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.com data. Meanwhile, Robinhood said it resolved earlier issues with crypto trading on its platform.“You have money looking for a home and this is one of those areas of the market where there is speculation happening, there is significant appreciation happening in a short period of time,” Chad Oviatt, director of investment management at Huntington Private Bank. “You get that excitement there.”The rallies defied easy explanation and continued a trend that’s seen the value of all digital tokens surge past $2.25 trillion. Doge, created as a joke in 2013, has been used in marketing gimmicks, the latest by the Oakland A’s baseball team, which offered two seats to games this week for 100 Dogecoin. The Gemini crypto exchange backed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss said it now supports Doge, and will soon enable trading of it.Dogecoin’s red-hot advance from around 0.002 cents a year ago -- when it was worth about $300 million -- has captured the interest of many on Wall Street. It’s even caught the attention of the Federal Reserve -- the central bank’s chairman last week answered “some of the asset prices are high” when asked if things like GameStop Corp.’s and Dogecoin’s supercharged rallies created threats to financial stability.As a sign of Dogecoin’s rising popularity, the Robinhood app is among the top 10 downloads at the Apple App Store. Meanwhile, Coinbase Global, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, doesn’t offer Doge trading -- saw its shares fall more than 6% Tuesday. The stock is on track for the lowest close since its market debut last month.“It’s pretty amazing that something that started out as a joke has become so popular,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co.Though interest in digital assets has picked up in recent months as more traditional firms who were long hesitant to the crypto space warm up to cryptocurrencies, it’s alternative coins that have captured the most attention in recent days. Bitcoin has taken a backseat following record-setting rallies from Ether and Doge, wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.“The Dogecoin bubble should have popped by now, but institutional interest is trying to take advantage of this momentum and that could support another push higher,” he said in a note. “Dogecoin is surging because many cryptocurrency traders do not want to miss out on any buzz that stems from Elon Musk’s hosting of Saturday Night Live.”Elsewhere, a new Ether ETF trading in Canada called the CI Galaxy Ethereum ETF (ETHX) broke its record volume on Tuesday, with more than $22 million shares changing hands as of 12:30 p.m. in New York. That fund has attracted about $162 million since its debut in March.Bitcoin slumped as much as 5.7% to $53,560, the third straight decline.Meanwhile, many -- including famed crypto investor Mike Novogratz -- have warned that the rallies could be unsustainable. Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings, said recently he’d be “very, very worried” were one of his friends to invest in Doge.“It seems that investors are careening from one hot dot to another, like a pinball game,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. “My sense is this speculative wave will suffer the same fate as the GME and other Robinhood ‘flash-in-the-pan’ stocks. Cryptocurrencies may have become a new asset class, like precious metals, but surges such as these seem unsustainable.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c0e5e2e1d88b1bb7fb7fa6f2f3a0894b6a3ae089f4719f7050a781773f39ac4f

PlayStation enabled cross-platform play in 2018.Likewise, Apple allows gamers to use Epic’s in-game virtual currency purchased on other platforms when playing games on iOS devices but Sony, which has also invested in Epic, doesn’t allow such cross-wallet play, Doren said.“Sony finally agreed to cross-platform play, but it has never agreed to cross-wallet transactions, is that correct?” Doren asked. “Yes,” Sweeney said.Sweeney was asked why he uses an iPhone over an Android phone -- a question meant to bolster Apple’s argument that App Store policies are designed to protect consumers from malware and security threats.How Apple’s App Store Sparked an Epic Trial: QuickTakeFor Apple, security and privacy are “fundamental differentiators,” Doren said. “You personally prefer to use iPhone because Apple’s approach to protecting your privacy is superior to Google’s?” he asked.Sweeney said, “That’s among the reasons.”Epic’s attorneys returned to question Sweeney to give him a chance to clarify his responses to some of Apple’s questions in the first two days of trial.Apple put Sweeney on the spot Monday to confirm that Epic takes a 40% cut when it publishes games created by other game developers. Sweeney drew a distinction from Apple’s App Store software distribution model, saying a publisher bears certain costs, including funding game development and marketing.Apple is also arguing that before Epic sued, it asked for a special side deal that would allow the company to run its own direct-payment system that circumvents App Store fees.“Would you have accepted a deal from Apple just for Epic, and not other developers?” Epic’s lawyer asked the CEO.Sweeney candidly said, “Yes, I would have.”When Sweeney’s testimony ended. Epic called Benjamin Simon, the chief executive officer of fitness app developer Yoga Buddhi, to the stand to discuss the App Store review process and developer interactions with Apple.(Updates with additional Sweeney testimony)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4dad8e8ff338763328c705e59bc8698a8a4b5e2ebf3971be7f52c066e4e955ea

Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney sought moral high ground on the first day of a trial against Apple Inc., saying he sued the world’s most valuable company not to boost sales of his Fortnite game but to stand up for developers cheated out of commissions by the App Store.Apple claims in court filings that Epic set up a public relations campaign last year to make Apple look like a “bad guy” to “revive flagging interest in Fortnite.”Sweeney, the first witness to take the stand in federal court in Oakland, California, said the lawsuit accusing the App Store of behaving like a monopoly while taking as much as a 30% cut from developers had nothing to do with Fortnite usage. “The lawsuit is entirely about Apple’s practices,” Sweeney said when questioned by Epic’s attorney.Later, the CEO held his ground when he was grilled on cross-examination about whether the lawsuit was intended to generate excitement around Fortnite.Sweeney said he waited to sue Apple until last year because it took him time to realize the “negative impact” of App Store policies. “It got to the point when Apple was making more profit from a developer’s app in the App Store than the developer was making himself.”Apple is facing a backlash from global regulators and some app developers who say its standard App Store fee of 30% and others policies are unfair and designed to benefit the iPhone maker’s own services. The fight with Epic blew up in August when the game maker told customers it would begin offering a discounted direct purchase plan for items in Fortnite, and Apple then removed the game app, cutting off access for more than a billion iPhone and iPad customers.Epic’s 2020 revenue totaled $5.1 billion, Sweeney said. When asked by Epic’s attorney how important Apple’s iOS is to his company, he said it was “vital.”U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers asked Sweeney if he knew Epic was violating its App Store contract when it released a “hotfix” update to open up its discounted direct-payment option in Fortnite. Epic knew its move was in direct violation of its contractual obligations with Apple, Sweeney said. He said he did so to “show the world exactly what the ramifications of Apple’s policies were.”On cross examination, Apple’s attorney challenged Sweeney over why he isn’t complaining about other gaming platforms, including Sony Corp., that also charge 30% commissions.Sweeney testified that he’s at odds with Apple’s practice of only giving users the option to make app purchases through its App Store and blocking them from downloading other app marketplaces on iOS mobile devices.(Updates with Sweeney’s cross-examination testimony)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8623730056e4f64494ad1fa4efee2e9576ebc02b779d7beca165c3aa619b15ab

In a July 2011 email, Schiller said he was a “staunch supporter” of the fee, but didn’t believe it would remain “unchanged forever.”The 30% fee and the rules regarding in-app purchases are two of the central issues to Epic’s lawsuit against Apple, alleging the iPhone maker’s actions are anticompetitive and unfairly deprive Epic of revenue. The fight blew up in August when Epic added its own payment system to the popular game Fortnite for in-app purchases, circumventing Apple’s system and, therefore, its fees. Apple then removed the game app, cutting off access for more than 1 billion iPhone and iPad customers.Schiller, in the email, suggested that if Apple were to eventually make a change to its fee structure, it should do so from a position of strength. “One thought,” he said, would be to adjust the fees once the App Store reached $1 billion per year in profit. He suggested a 25% or 20% fee if that would still generate the $1 billion in annual profit.“I know that this is controversial, I just tee it up as another way to look at the size of the business, what we want to achieve, and how we stay competitive,” Schiller wrote in the email presented Monday during the trial.Apple, responding to the email, said Schiller didn’t say in 2011 whether the App Store made $1 billion in profit and and there is no indication the fee structure is tied to the profit produced by the App Store.Apple tweaked its App Store fees in 2016, reducing its commission from 30% to 15% for the second year of users who subscribe to a service. Late last year, Apple started a program to cut fees from 30% to 15% for developers who generated $1 million or less in the previous calendar year. Still, the 30% level remains in some cases, including for developers like Epic who make more than $1 million a year.The App Store is considered profitable at a rate of well over $1 billion per year. An Epic expert witness calculated that Apple’s profit margin is about 80% for the App Store. Analyst Sensor Tower estimates the App Store generated $22 billion in commissions last year for Apple before its profit margin.The case is Epic Games Inc. v.

Epic charged Apple and Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google in August for the unjustified removal of Fortnite from their mobile app stores. Apple and Alphabet had justified the removal as Epic had violated the App store terms by bypassing the 30% fee by introducing its in-app payment system, including running a smear campaign against the iPhone maker, Reuters reports. Epic alleged Apple’s App Store monopoly strategy of eliminating competition by charging exorbitant fees. Epic-backed expert Ned Barnes has testified that Apple’s App Store had a 77.8& operating margin in 2019 and 74.9% in 2018. Apple countered Epic’s allegations by crediting App Store rules for the safety and security in opening customer wallets to unknown developers. CEO Tim Sweeney will represent Epic. The company’s witness list includes other company executives, former Apple employees, and employees of companies including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT). Apple’s witness list includes CEO Tim Cook, other executives like App Store, and Apple events leader Phil Schiller. Epic sought an end to multiple unjustified Apple practices. Price action: AAPL shares traded higher by 1.06% at $132.86 on the last check Monday.

The fight with Epic blew up in August when the game maker told customers it would begin offering a discounted direct purchase plan for items in Fortnite, and Apple then removed the game app, cutting off access for more than a billion iPhone and iPad customers.“Epic is here, demanding that this court force Apple to let into its App Store untested and untrusted apps and app stores, which is something Apple has never done,” Dunn told U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who is hearing the case without a jury. “Apple’s unwavering commitment to safety, security, reliability and quality does not allow that, and the antitrust laws do not require it.”Earlier, Epic’s attorney had assailed the App Store as predatory, saying its monopolistic behavior is part of the “walled garden” of the Apple IOS ecosystem.Epic “has dedicated enormous resources to take on the biggest company in the world,” in a fight not just for itself but all developers, lawyer Katherine Forrest said.How Apple’s App Store Sparked an Epic Trial: QuickTakeUsers are locked in by costs and developers by “onerous” contractual obligations with Apple that closely monitors and polices how its App Store functions, said Forrest, a former federal judge in Manhattan. Apple co-founder and former chief executive officer Steve Jobs told a high-level engineering executive as far back as 2008 that the App Store licensing agreement is designed to “avoid competitors,” Forrest said.As the three-week trial kicks off, Epic is presenting its witnesses first, starting with Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney. In his first minutes of testimony, he told the judge that he started working with an Apple device when he was 12 but that the company’s policies have become “more and more restrictive” for developers over the years.Later, Apple will call CEO Tim Cook and top executives Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi to the witness stand to explain how they designed the App Store, Dunn said.As hundreds of people from the public and the media dialed in to an audio feed for the trial, which is expected to run for three weeks, Gonzalez Rogers called the case “high stakes” and said it raises “difficult issues.”The case is Epic Games Inc. v. Apple Inc., 20-cv-05640, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c1795c1c461ef9ac3cf52b1535b43074e8a267f6602c6e0d0879124ffb4c8e05
