        "Built an end-to-end stock market sentiment analysis pipeline by aggregating and processing 10,450+ financial news articles from multiple APIs (NewsAPI, Finnhub, StockNews) to model market sentiment signals.",
        "Engineered NLP features from unlabeled text using VADER sentiment scoring, TF-IDF, GloVe embeddings, and Word2Vec to transform raw news data into model-ready inputs.",
        "Trained and evaluated deep learning and statistical models, including bidirectional LSTM networks and SARIMAX, to predict short-term stock movement direction and price trends.",
        "Achieved 92.8% classification accuracy and ~89% ROC-AUC on imbalanced sentiment data, and successfully forecasted stock price movements up to 30 minutes ahead."
