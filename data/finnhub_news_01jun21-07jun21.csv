For anyone fascinated by feuds amongst the mega-caps, there could plenty to savoir at this year's virtual event. As par for the course, Apple is expected to announce iOS upgrades and software improvements for the coming year, but Wedbush’s Daniel Ives also believes the introduction of iOS 15 could create some additional friction in an escalating dispute with a rival tech giant.



“We expect data privacy and security to be a main focus and theme of Cook's keynote as Apple solidifies its privacy policy with the iOS 15 unveil,” the 5-star analyst said. “This follows the iOS 14.5 release which has doubled down on privacy features for the consumer at a time which Apple has directly put itself on a collision course with Facebook around the ability for users to block data tracking.”



That possible conflict aside, various notifications/lock screen changes are also anticipated as part of the update which could also include a “revamped iMessage feature set.”



Ives also expects non-software related announcements. Namely, the analyst thinks a surprise is in store on the hardware front; Ives anticipates an announcement of a new MacBook Pro release, with a 14-inch and 16-inch display “driven by the M1 chip.”



The analyst also thinks there will be “hints around upcoming initiatives with some breadcrumbs dropped as developers crave bigger AR functionality in the works for the coming years.”



Looking ahead, Ives projects that by next summer (2022), the “long-awaited” Apple Glasses will be unveiled. And as if ratcheting up the volume in the Facebook squabble is not enough, Tesla is in Apple’s sights too. By 2024, Ives believes the Apple Car will could see the light of day and assumes “more news/partnerships this summer on this front.”



So, down to business, what does this all mean for AAPL investors? Ives reiterated an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares backed by a $185 price target. Investors could be sitting on gains of 47%, should the forecast play out as expected. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)



Not all on the Street are convinced it is time to load up on Apple stock although the majority remains in the Cupertino giant’s corner. Based on 19 Buys vs. 5 Holds and 2 Sells, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target currently stands at $157.58, suggesting the upcoming year will yield returns of 25%.

The iPhone maker initially aimed to debut the service in May but encountered problems after uploading shows onto the platform.

Apple's Podcasts have been around for years, offering free shows on a variety of topics. But in April, Apple announced it was introducing a premium podcast service that will enable listeners to support their favorite podcasters. In return, listeners will enjoy an enhanced experience with ad-free listening and access to exclusive content.

“Apple Podcasts is the best place for listeners to discover and enjoy millions of great shows…We’re excited to introduce this powerful new platform to creators around the world,” said Apple’s Internet services head, Eddy Cue.

Apple will let podcast creators set their subscription prices and decide what perks to offer to their listeners. For the opportunity to sell podcast subscriptions on Apple's platform, creators will pay a $19.99 annual fee. Additionally, Apple will take a cut of podcast subscription sales that the creators generate. The company’s commission will be 30% in the first year and 15% in subsequent years.

The premium podcast service will expand Apple’s roster of subscription services, including Apple Music and Apple TV+. The company is increasingly leaning on service sales to drive growth. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks)

Last week, New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu downgraded Apple stock to Sell from Hold, setting a price target of $90 (27.77% downside potential).

The analyst anticipates weak iPhone demand in Fiscal 2022 after record sales in Fiscal 2021.

“We see material downside risk – shipments in the 180-200m range vs. consensus at 234m,” noted Ferragu.

Despite Ferragu's bearish stance, consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 18 Buy, 5 Hold, and 2 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $156.52 implies 25.61% upside potential to the current price.

(TSM) or TSMC will collaborate with Japanese companies on a government-backed project to advance chipmaking technologies in Japan.

According to Nikkei Asia, Japan’s position in the global semiconductor industry has been declining. In a bid to improve the country’s competitiveness, the government sought TSMC’s help. 

As a result, TSMC will set up a research and development facility in Japan in partnership with the government. It will use that facility to collaborate with more than 20 Japanese companies on semiconductor technology advancements. The participating companies will include Ibiden, Asahi Kasei, Shin-Etsu Chemical, Shibaura Mechatronics, and Nagase.

TSMC will invest about $337 million in the project, which is about half of the project’s cost. The Japanese government will also fund the project. The research facility will be set up at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Ibaraki Prefecture. The project will begin with a trial before entering full operation in 2022.

In addition to helping advance Japan’s chip technology, the Japanese government is also expecting TSMC to set up a manufacturing plant in the country. TSMC is the world’s largest contract chipmaker with customers including Apple (AAPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM). (See TSMC stock analysis on TipRanks)

On April 15, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini reiterated a Sell rating on TSM but raised the price target from $83 to $85, implying 27.57% downside potential. The analyst observed that TSMC’s $100 billion capex plan would drive revenue growth for the next three years, but depreciation and higher operating expenses will weigh on earnings. 

“Strengthening demand environment, in our opinion, is enabling TSM to increase wafer prices across most nodes, though the sustainability of wafer price increase into 2022 and beyond is not clear,” noted Hosseini.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 1 Buy, 2 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $83 implies a 29.28% downside potential from the current price.

TSM scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting the stock is likely to outperform the market.
