on derek chauvin being tried for the murder of george floyd when prosecutors played an audio clip of floyd s final words i can t breathe she screamed in agony ross the us ceo and highestranking black woman at the publicrelations giant edelman felt floyd s pain was her own with the help of her daughter ross was able to calm down but in that moment she knew floyd s death and chauvin s verdict would have significant implications on her role as an executive at work i was screaming ross told insider because my brothers and father look like george floyd floyd s death was a breaking point for millions of people around the globe a decadeslong culmination of unchecked police brutality and racial injustice business leaders were then pressured to respond quickly and decisively reprioritizing their obligations to the employees and communities they serve it was a massive public and nationwide shift toward society as a whole not just shareholders despite some resistance from republican politicians and constituents floyd s legacy continues to expand the role of ceo to include addressing pervasive social ills by raising wages investing in underserved communities and hiring and promoting more people from marginalized backgrounds multiple experts said for jamie dimon ceo of jpmorgan chase floyd s murder was a turning point for the financial firm watching the events unfold after george floyd s murder we understood that we as a company could do more to serve and lead dimon told insider in an exclusive statement it was a moment when many companies had to decide or recommit to what they stood for shortly after floyd s death jpmorgan pledged more than billion to promote racial justice the biggest single investment of a us company toward racial equity in the past year now more than ever we are working to make inclusivity and equity a central part of everything we do dimon said other companies like citi mastercard and apple committed large investments companies withdrew millions in ads from facebook to pressure the socialmedia giant to stop the spread of racist content chipotle and starbucks tied executive compensation to meeting diversity equity and inclusion targets business leaders hired dei consultants at record rates in the past year ross has urged hiring managers at edelman to be more inclusive in their recruiting since may of senior hires at the firm have been women or people of color ross also created a task force to help some new corporate clients craft meaningful pledges to advance racial equity i was like a dog with a bone ross who oversees thousands of employees said nothing and no one could stop me zander lurie ceo of surveymonkey said he too felt his role quickly evolved after floyd died before george floyd s death we cared a lot about dei but not on the same pedestal as our product and sales goals lurie who s white told insider now we re more fearless about stating that we believe worldclass execution in the dei arena is as important as the products we ship and the revenue targets we set when it comes to racial justice workers customers and investors are holding ceos to higher standards they want them to be leaders in not just the business world but also in society i almost feel bad for these guys they re grappling with their role ross said things are different about one year before floyd s death the role of the ceo had already begun to change in jpmorgan s dimon along with other business executives published a public letter that called for a departure from shareholder primacy the notion championed by economist milton friedman in the s that the sole purpose of a company is to drive profits for shareholders the theory held sway over business for decades resulting in business leaders chasing profits and costcutting measures above all else the letter signified that top ceos were growing distant from friedman s philosophies rising pollution levels and a widening class gap have increased the stakes affecting their businesses the letter essentially told americans that ceos were going to double down on these issues floyd s death in along with the pandemic were the first major tests according to just capital a nonprofit research firm it was a turning point yusuf george a managing director of corporate engagement at just capital who is black said it accelerated the move toward stakeholder capitalism the growth in environmental social and governance investments and projects over the past year shows a shift in shareholder values this spring there were more than esg proposals for shareholders to vote on one group of investors representing more than trillion in assets made headlines in april asking banks to conduct a thirdparty audit of their racialequity plans investors are pushing for more transparency george said ceos need to be bold in the initiatives they re launching the video of floyd s death shook many business leaders and workers to their core when i saw the video i was shocked disturbed and disappointed by what i witnessed chipotle ceo brian niccol who is white said it was and still is a tough video to watch it compelled millions across the world to protest racism and police brutality and people didn t want statements they wanted action a survey by the harris poll and just capital found that more than of the participants wanted leaders to promote diversity and inclusion within their companies chipotle s niccol said he took more time to connect with workers he said he spent the next year listening to black and brown employees in a series of conversations and panel events a good first step according to dei experts he also tied executive compensation to dei goals i spent a lot of time listening surveymonkey s lurie said that s one of the most important things leaders can do today tiffany jana a dei strategist who works with fortune companies said demand for their services increased exponentially in the weeks after floyd s murder mandy price ceo and cofounder of kanarys a dei technology platform said her phone was ringing constantly with new inquiries before floyd s tragic death many ceos saw dei as a nice to have not a need to have but that s no longer the case price said one of the first actions lurie took last summer was hiring a chief diversity and social impact officer who reports directly to him he also organized multiple meetings in which black and brown employees shared their experiences with racism in order to create a more inclusive culture the company issued a bonus policy for erg group leaders raised more than for blackrun nonprofits and committed to increasing the number of blackowned businesses it works with by the company wants its workforce to include women from underrepresented minorities and nonbinary jose minaya ceo of nuveen tiaa s investment manager said floyd s death stirred a mix of emotions for him it made me angry confused i was trying to understand how does this happen minaya who is latino said after it was playing out and seeing the reactions of people speaking out i also felt optimistic because some of the right conversations were happening a wave of workers at refinery glossier adidas and everlane drove much of that conversation last summer they spoke out about racism and unfair working conditions at refinery for example one employee tweeted that an executive once confused her with a caterer another employee tweeted she was paid less than her two white coworkers who were doing the same job the site s top editor and a cofounder resigned soon after increasingly employees and consumers are expecting corporations to take a stand on social issues robert kazanjian a business professor at emory university said in a sense employees feel the right to hold their management accountable the tech company basecamp encouraged employees to read books on antiracism during the protests that followed floyd s death but weeks ago the company banned conversations about societal and political topics at work over onethird of employees resigned as a result in addition many people expected ceos to speak out on georgia s restrictive voting laws passed in april as evidenced by protests and socialmedia posts that populated the internet for ceos you can t say something about racial equity and everything else and then not say something about voter suppression and inequity happening in georgia ross said because these are the same issues at play despite ceos speaking out more on social and political issues and investing more in diversity initiatives some worry business leaders are merely engaging in temporary performative allyship or speaking out for good optics i fear that many corporations seized the opportunity to engage in blackwashing focusing on performative bipoc inclusion at the expense of substantive change jana who is black and nonbinary said over the long term companies that merely engage in temporary diversity and inclusion work will be called out by consumers investors and employees they added not all consumers and employees are onboard with ceos becoming social activists some republican leaders and their constituents have called for boycotts against companies like cocacola delta and microsoft after leaders criticized voting laws or bills in georgia texas and florida but polling shows that the majority of americans support most causes ceos have been speaking out about recently like voting access racial equity and the climate crisis minaya is optimistic about the future the stars have aligned the right conversations are happening he said if you want to attract the best talent and retain them if you want to attract clients and customers you have to do a better job of letting the public know what your values as a firm are you have to stand by them chauvin was convicted for the murder of floyd on april george of just capital remembers watching the trial sitting on the couch in his queens apartment holding his monthold son as the

pressure from the state for its most successful tech firms to stay in line but zhang writes that he wants to focus on longerterm initiatives and step away from the daytoday nitty gritty i worry that i am still relying too much on the ideas i had before starting the company and haven t challenged myself by updating those concepts he says recently several colleagues have asked me why i haven t updated my okrs frankly i feel i did not achieve as much as i had hoped to on my previous objectives in the areas of new strategic opportunities organizational management and social responsibility since the beginning of this year i ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to better drive real longterm breakthroughs which cannot simply rely on steady but incremental progress after several months of thinking about this i came to the conclusion that transitioning out of the role of ceo with all of the related daytoday responsibilities would enable me to have greater impact on longerterm initiatives let me explain how i came to this conclusion our success over the last nine years has been predicated upon our ability to innovate at just the right moment in the development of the industry notably this has included applying machine learning to mobile and video products between graduating from college and starting bytedance i spent a lot of time thinking and learning about challenges like effectively disseminating information using technology to improve products and approaching the development of a company much like one would a product through constant reevaluation adjustment and iteration that period of profound thinking and ideation helped lay the groundwork for bytedance with our business growing well it is time to think about how we can not simply scale but make innovative meaningful longterm progress towards our mission to inspire creativity enrich life innovation and success are rooted in years of exploring and imagining what is possible however few people have real insight into the future preferring to model on current and past achievements people are amazed by the success of electric cars but they forget that tesla is years old and first experimented with laptop batteries to power its vehicles people know about apple s software management tool homebrew but few realize that computer geeks were discussing the apple i in the homebrew club in the s virtual reality life science and scientific computation are playing a bigger role in people s lives as technology brings evergreater impact to society this type of progress requires us to break through the inertia and to keep exploring at our th anniversary i shared a line from alice in wonderland why sometimes i ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast i like to think about possibilities that are still just that possibilities for a long time i ve put my online status as daydreaming what i mean isn t that i m zoning out but rather that i m thinking about possibilities that people might think are just fantasy in the past three years many things that seemed like fantasies have in fact become reality yet i worry that i am still relying too much on the ideas i had before starting the company and haven t challenged myself by updating those concepts as an example before i spent a lot of time keeping track of developments in machine learning however since then while i do my best to bookmark technical articles online i haven t had the time to make much progress digging into the area during technology meetings this sometimes means i actually struggle to keep up with the discussion three years ago i spoke with some entrepreneurs about the challenges of scaling a business i said that often when companies mature and expand many fall into the trap of the ceo becoming overly central listening to presentations handling approvals and making decisions reactively this leads to an overreliance on existing ideas already in the company and results in knowledge structures being slow to iterate in order to avoid this trap i gradually came to a decision over the last six months to take on a new role at bytedance i believe i can best challenge the limits of what the company can achieve over the next decade and drive innovation by drawing on my strengths of highlyfocused learning systematic thought and a willingness to attempt new things i also believe that giving back to society is an important piece of this and we have already made some headway exploring new initiatives in education brain disease research and digitizing ancient books having been involved in some of these myself i hope to do more by contributing my own ideas and helping deliver new solutions at the same time there are still many things that we need to improve and i think someone else can better drive progress through areas like improved daily management the truth is i lack some of the skills that make an ideal manager i m more interested in analyzing organizational and market principles and leveraging these theories to further reduce management work rather than actually managing people similarly i m not very social preferring solitary activities like being online reading listening to music and daydreaming about what may be possible in march i began discussing with a small group the possibility of having rubo the cofounder of bytedance taking over as ceo and leveraging his strengths in management organization and social engagement the team was understanding and supported the idea rubo previously helped me found another company so we have worked together closely for many years as many of you know rubo has taken on numerous critical roles at bytedance at different times including head of r d lark and efficiency engineering and most recently human resources and management as we ve scaled up at an incredible rate globally since day rubo has been an invaluable partner completing my coding for new systems buying and installing servers and developing key recruitment and corporate policies and management systems among a list of contributions too long to enumerate over the next six months we will work side by side to ensure the smoothest possible transition and i know you will all also support him a few years ago i posted on social media the meaning of travel lies in switching time and space which helps you observe others lives in a new environment as a stranger and reflect on yourself and your life with a detached eye after handing over my role as ceo and removing myself from the responsibilities of daily management i will have the space to explore longterm strategies organizational culture and social responsibility with a more objective perspective on the company in our business plan i told the team that the most rewarding thing about building a company is being able to enjoy the journey together i look forward to this new phase and continuing our voyage together

its target for cutting emissions from to appear to be two leaps forward for humankind by pushing for urgent action to turn the tide on disastrous climate change the question however is whether the politicians who attended biden s climate summit will be able to commandeer the companies that produce the vast majority of climate destroying emissions into action to deliver their targets policymakers are critical in that they have the power to turn progressive voluntary action by a small group of companies to cut their carbon footprint into mandatory requirements governing entire sectors rewarding early adopters levelling the playing field and scaling up impact it s why ford volkswagen honda bmw and volvo supported california in its battle with the trump administration which sought to reverse rules set by the state a decade ago requiring automakers to reduce co emissions by around between now and others including gm nissan toyota and subaru in the coalition for sustainable automotive regulation a case of doublespeak if ever there was one backed trump s lawsuit though gm and nissan pulled out just after biden s election and the rest left in february the same dynamic is playing out at the moment in the eu where europe s automakers are due to find out in july what their contribution to the eu s new climate target will be reuters reports that volkswagen which owns porsche audi vw seat and skoda is telegraphing to policymakers that it would support even more ambitious cuts in emissions upsetting smaller rivals who want brussels to give them more leeway but just how prepared are even the most ambitious companies to follow where policymakers have said they will lead in partnership with signal climate analytics reuters has been exploring the extent to which the top publicly traded emitters which together account for more than a third of global co emissions are bringing their operations in line with the global agenda of keeping global temperature rises to well below c looking at the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the transportation sector which accounts for about a fifth of global co in the accompanying chart we see the following pledges with the final dark green bar awarded to firms that have made a commitment similar to the new countrywide u s goal with a target over the next decade committing to over decarbonisation among the names on the list only five of them ap moellermaersk daimler delta airlines general motors and volkswagen have made a sufficient commitment in line with a sub c world according to signal climate analytics another have set targets in line with science but have not set targets for action in their dominant emissions type those from their product use and supply chains known as their scope emissions in the next nine years looking more broadly at the largest emitters only have committed to meaningful decarbonisation in the next decade there has been a lack of guidance for how companies can set credible netzero goals and equally importantly a mechanism to hold their feet to the fire and ensure they follow through the science based targets initiative which was set up in ahead of the paris climate summit has until now only set rules for decarbonisation of companies direct operations in line with a c world netzero carbon targetsetting by both countries and companies is a more recent phenomenon in the wake of the ipccc report that stressed the need for emissions to fall to zero by to keep global warning to c sbti is in the process of developing a global standard for netzero businesses which will have to align with a below c world but it will not be published until later this year the new standard will have requirements for monitoring verification and annual reporting of progress towards targets something that has until now been missing tim nixon ceo of signal climate analytics says there should be far more data disclosure from companies about their environmental impacts including their capacity to deliver progressively larger emissions reductions over time through specific product and operational innovation of renewable energy sources to fill the energy gap in their value chain to eliminate human rights abuses particularly in sectors like metals mining and consumer goods implement circularity of their products and processes regulators are already moving to force their hands in this direction internationally the londonbased international financial reporting standards foundation ifrs has been asked by governments and financial regulators to establish a consistent single set of global standards on how listed companies should disclose risks from climatechange in their operations this will replace the current patchwork of public and privatesector approaches that make it harder for investors to compare companies and has allowed for the proliferation of greenwash in april officials leading the project said it aims to publish its first batch of standards by the middle of next year in europe a new proposed corporate sustainability reporting directive was published in april that will require companies to publish information on how their strategy aligns with limiting global warming to c and to the eu s own climate transition benchmarks and such action now looks likely to be replicated in the u s where there are currently no mandatory standards for disclosing climate risks following the biden administration s new executive order on climaterelated risk according to mindy lubber ceo of esg nonprofit ceres sen elizabeth warren and rep sean casten are expected to reintroduce senate and house bills soon that would require companies to disclose climate risk while for the first time publicly traded companies including apple hp salesforce and uber have announced public support for regulatory action by the sec to mandate climate disclosure rules but nixon says he doesn t think companies should be let off the hook from taking action now there will not be agreement in our lifetime on the perfect standard and competing regional claims for a new global standard will likely extend the debate he says companies know where their emissions are concentrated and they can choose to report and reduce starting today and progress meaningfully and transparently over the next decade he adds we desperately need a new protocol like that agreed in montreal for ozone which was completed in less than months once the severity of the problem was agreed nixon said such a treaty would build on current regional proposals and bind all nations together on a unified corporate framework for reporting and targets in absence of such an instrument he said we are left looking largely to the heads of

Representations of the virtual currency B… [+5415 chars]",discover thomson reuters by mike dolan min read london reuters bitcoin s wild ride this week is far from unusual for the largest crypto token but the rollercoaster is also its inherent contradiction speculators betting for years on bitcoin becoming a stateless digital currency that s widely used for online retail and payments are largely responsible for its parabolic price rises but they also seed the sort of blinding volatility that makes that ambition almost untenable bitcoin s plunge on tuesday after another chinese government crackdown is not unique daily moves of more than have been frequent during the past years at almost median daily price swings over that time period are more than times that of the main transatlantic euro dollar exchange rate and while some online retailers might accept bitcoin as payment for goods priced in dollars few could manage the potential accounting chaos of sticker pricing in bitcoin if its value can routinely shift by a fifth in just hours the flipside is true for buyers if you think bitcoin s price keeps on rising over time much like the latest quadrupling over the past months then why would you surrender those gains by paying for anything with bitcoin today and so if that role as a transaction currency or stable store of value remains elusive it s essentially just a game of hoarding a finite number of tokens by small groups of people that routinely involves wild illiquid swings whenever regulators pounce backers tweet support or big players cash in as ever arguments about pros and cons of crypto tokens divide among believers and nonbelievers blind faith versus instant dismissal cheerleading versus scorn deutsche bank this week likened bitcoin belief structures to the socalled tinkerbell effect a theory drawing from childrens book character peter pan s claim that the fairy only exists because the kids believe she does in other words the value of bitcoin is entirely based on wishful thinking wrote deutsche analyst marion laboure laboure estimates that less than of transactions in bitcoin are currently related to payments the rest is trading speculation investment or related activities and she reckons its liquidity as an investment asset is low with about million bitcoins changing hands last year that s of all those in circulation almost half the equivalent metric for apple shares with a market capitalisation still about trillion governments can t ignore bitcoin even if central banks continue to dismiss its wider systemic importance they may even welcome the fact its emergence over the past decade has spurred socalled fintech innovation as they gradually develop their own central bank digital currencies over the coming years but deutsche s laboure reckons more crackdowns will come and most likely the whenever bitcoin even looks like rivalling their currencies for payment it is no surprise that governments are not inclined to give up their monetary monopolies throughout history governments first regulate and then take ownership if so what s the endgame of all the speculation and hoarding which just further limits bitcoin supply and drives the price higher is it just pass the parcel while the music keeps playing or are people with money to burn punting for quick gains and trading strategically by timing entry and exits some argue there is genuine demand for crypto transfers within the half trillion dollars per year of global remittances as migrant workers often need to funnel money back to poorer countries with strict formal exchange controls others claim crypto privacy features draw in demand from criminals as per this month s ransomeware hack at colonial pipeline but that will just hasten more regulation investment arguments beyond simply punting it ever higher range from a lack of correlation with other assets to a potential role as an inflation hedge an odd assertion given its latest reversal comes amid all the postpandemic inflation scares powerful backers have a outsize say too but are increasingly erratic tesla billionaire elon musk drove the price skywards earlier this year by saying tesla would accept bitcoins as payment for its dollarpriced electric vehicle and add bitcoin to the company balance sheet only to backtrack last week by warning about excessive energy usage in bitcoin mining with no obvious rationale star tech stock investor cathie wood of ark invest claimed this week that bitcoin would rise another tenfold again after it registered a loss in a month at the level she posits the market cap of bitcoin would then be trillion or a third of the entire m money supply of g economies london school of economics jon danielsson reckons that as a result of the concentration of bitcoin ownership that sort of move would create new multi billionaires or even the first trillionaire and that would wildly exaggerate existing wealth skews as the gap between bitcoin haves and havenots soars to intolerable levels making a mockery of claims of crypto democratisation as a result he thinks coexistence of bitcoin and socalled fiat currencies is impossible it s all or nothing if it replaces all g currencies in circulation that would then see each bitcoin priced at million reality or fiction bitcoin is a bubble danielsson concludes it makes sense to ride the

thursday harry and his brother prince william pressed for higher standards in the news media after the report found the bbc had acted to cover up the journalist s deceitful behavior bashir later worked for msnbc both he and the bbc apologized after the report s release though bashir noted that diana had said she had no regrets over the interview william said it had brought him indescribable sadness to know that lies presented to his mother contributed to the fear paranoia and isolation that plagued diana in the years prior to her death the documentary also sees harry tell winfrey that as an adult he at times turned to excessive alcohol and drugs i was willing to drink i was willing to take drugs i was willing to try and do the things that made me feel less like i was feeling he said

question that has begun to dog consumers in the modern streaming age it s also one that could eventually become a lot simpler if media mergers heat up at t s announcement on monday that it had struck a deal to spin off warnermedia the owner of hbo cnn tnt and several other major media businesses and combine it with discovery a sizable media operation in its own right with food network hgtv the oprah winfrey network travel channel and others became one of the first major media mergers of the streaming age it combines two streaming operations that were sizable but still small compared to the likes of netflix and disney the move hints at what analysts and media industry experts say is a move toward consolidation the expectation is for more mergers and acquisitions soon it s going to put pressure on everyone else craig moffett of the research company moffettnathanson said of the at t deal on yahoo finance live netflix knew they were going to have to compete against some big players and clearly that means discovery will be one of those big players amazon i think just by virtue of who they are was going to be one of those big players some talks were already underway in recent weeks amazon has been in talks to acquire mgm the movie studio behind the james bond and rocky franchises according to a person familiar with the negotiations technology industry publication the information first reported the talks a deal would give amazon more than film titles and television episodes to add to its streaming library apple and comcast have also eyed mgm two sources said the emergence of the streaming industry quickly gave rise to dozens of companies looking to offer services ranging from niche interests like anime and horror movies to bundles from major media companies such as nbcuniversal s peacock or viacomcbs paramount nbcuniversal is the parent company of nbc news and while the pickandchoose nature of the businesses offered consumers some upside when compared to the allornothing cable bundle it had already become a chore to figure out how to watch a particular show and whether it was something worth paying for month after month it s an issue that may in part be fixed by the need for streaming services to be bigger both in terms of the libraries of content they hold but also the amount of money they can spend on new content i think everybody is concluding that to play in this streaming business is really hard and really expensive said paul hardart a professor of marketing at new york university and the director of its entertainment media and technology program and you need scale and i think you will start to see more of these companies combining to see that scale because it s a very very expensive game that volume of offerings could offer some advantages to consumers much as the cable bundle once offered upside for being a onestop shop albeit an expensive one rajkumar venkatesan a professor of business administration at the university of virginia who focuses on analytics said the consolidation is part of a natural cycle streaming platforms offered an unbundled experience that could deliver ondemand content in a better way than cable packages but now that those experiences are becoming commoditized they re starting to rebundle along the way some media companies once seen as major players nbc and cbs among them can no longer rely on their size these are big brands in the old world but they are smaller than netflix and disney in the new world venkatesan said that means even a sizable media operation like comcast s nbcuniversal could be in need of more content media analysts have speculated that comcast could look to pull a maneuver similar to at t s by combining nbcuniversal with another large media company the big questions now are why did comcast not take a shot at trying to merge nbcu with warnermedia and will comcast follow at t s lead and spinoff nbcu and merge with another media company wrote the technology media and telecommunications research firm lightshed partners in a blog post following the announcement of the discovery deal lightshed has aggressively advocated for media consolidation to compete with netflix and disney a spokesperson for comcast declined to comment nbcuniversal did not immediately respond to requests for comment for consumers that means the fractured streaming experience could become more streamlined and with more content companies will operate with more user data which venkatesan said could mean better automated recommendations and targeted content creation he also suggested a few major players will have to compete on price to retain customers but that s not a foregone conclusion and there are already indications that the u s government will take a close look at the warnermedia deal to make sure it is good for consumers critics of consolidation have argued that prices for consumers have steadily risen because larger companies have less competition sen richard blumenthal dconn tweeted monday afternoon that the deal demands close scrutiny to protect consumers pocket books instead of accelerating further concentration among corporate behemoths recent lax antitrust enforcement has allowed a dramatic consolidation in the media market that is driving up prices limiting consumer choice blumenthal added tv viewers sports lovers deserve more choices about how they get their entertainment better competition over services lower prices some in the entertainment industry have said that consolidation is changing the work that is made writing in the new york times in director martin scorsese offered a warning the situation sadly is that we now have two separate fields there s worldwide audiovisual entertainment and there s cinema

philanthropist he drew wide attention as a selfstyled expert on covid he endeared himself to selfproclaimed nerds as they ascended in popular culture even making a cameo appearance on the sitcom the big bang theory but in the wake of the announcement that gates the cofounder of microsoft and his wife melinda french gates plan to divorce after years of marriage a series of news reports have complicated his celebrity persona and raised questions about his personal life the wall street journal citing people familiar with the matter reported sunday that gates left the microsoft board last year during an investigation into a romantic relationship with a female company employee that was deemed inappropriate in a statement a microsoft spokesperson said that in the company was made aware of a concern that gates sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year gates spokesperson confirmed that there was an affair almost years ago which ended amicably bill s decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter the spokesperson said gates said last year that he was stepping down from the board to dedicate more time to philanthropic priorities the new york times citing people with direct knowledge of gates behavior reported sunday that he pursued women who worked for him at microsoft and at the bill and melinda gates foundation creating what were described as uncomfortable work environments nbc news has not independently confirmed that report and a spokesperson for gates said in part that the claim of mistreatment of employees is also false the journal and the times have both reported that french gates was uncomfortable with her husband s ties to the convicted sex offender jeffrey epstein a friendship that was reported to have begun in three years after epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor however a spokesperson for gates said he had absolutely no business partnership or personal

antitrust case but rather than a fiery condemnation of epic s shenanigans and allegations cook offered a mild carefully tended ignorance that left many of the lawsuit s key questions unanswered or unanswerable this anticlimax may not make for exciting reporting but it could serve to defang the dangerous if somewhat dubious argument that apple s app store amounts to a monopoly epic cries monopoly as apple details secret project liberty effort to provoke fortnite ban after being called by apple s own attorneys cook took the stand law s dorothy atkins one of two media members allowed in the court reported in her comprehensive live tweeting of the testimony the quotes from cook are as reported and not to be considered verbatim the court transcript will follow when the document is compiled and public incidentally atkins stagesetting descriptions are appealing and humanizing though epic ceo tim sweeney comes off as a bit weird sweeney is sitting at epic s counsel table looking down at his pen his lawyer gary bornstein sporadically whispers in his ear cook seems relaxed legs crossed just turned to someone sitting next took him said something and then laughed these trying times doratki may the questioning of cook by his own company s counsel was gentle and directed at reiterating the reasons why apple s app store is superior and sufficient for ios users while also asserting the presence of stiff competition he admitted to a handful of conflicts with developers such as differing priorities or needing to improve discovery but said the company works constantly to retain developers and users the fa ade of innocent ignorance began when he was asked about apple s r d numbers billion annually for the last three years specifically he said that apple couldn t estimate how much of that money was directed toward the app store because we don t allocate like that i e research budgets for individual products aren t broken out from the rest now that doesn t sound right does it a company like apple knows down to the penny how much it spends on its products and research even if it can t be perfectly broken down an advance in macos code may play into a feature on the app store the company must know to some extent how its resources are being deployed and to what effect the differences between a conservative and liberal estimation of the app store s r d allocation might be large in the hundreds of millions perhaps but make no mistake those estimations are almost certainly being made internally to do otherwise would be folly but because the numbers are not publicly declared and broken down and because they are likely to be somewhat fuzzy cook can say truthfully that there s no single number like to invent an amount app store r d was million in not having a hard number removes a potential foothold for epic which could use it either way if it s big they re protecting their golden goose enforcing market power if it s small they re just collecting the eggs collecting rent via market power apple s only winning move is not to play so cook plays dumb and consequently epic s argument looks like speculation and as apple would argue fabulation he then deployed a similar strategy of starving the competition with a preemptive shrug about profits he only addressed total net sales which were about billion at a profit margin saying apple does not evaluate the app store s income as a standalone business certainly it is arguable that the app store is very much a tightly integrated component of a larger business structure but the idea that it cannot be assessed as a standalone business is ludicrous it is again nearly certain that it like all of apple s divisions and product lines is dissected and reported internally in excruciating detail but again it is just plausible that for legal purposes it is not straightforward enough to say the income and profits of the app store are such and such thus denying epic its datum apple app store customers spent b over the week of christmas set a spending record on new year s day however the point is important enough that epic thought it warranted independent investigation and among the first things epic s attorney brought up when the witness was turned over to him was the testimony from earlier in the trial by an expert witness that apple s app store operating margins were around it was not in apple s interest to confirm or deny these numbers and cook again pleaded ignorance the mask slipped a tiny bit however when epic s attorney asked cook to break down the confidential income numbers that combined the mac and ios app stores while apple objected to this saying it was privileged information and could only be divulged in a closed court cook offered that the ios numbers are a lot larger than the mac numbers what we see here is another piece of financial sleightofhand by mixing the ios and mac income apple gets to muddy the waters of how much money is made and spent in and on them epic s attempt to unmix them was not successful but the judge is no fool she sees the same things epic does but just as dimly apple is attempting to deny epic a legal victory even at the cost of looking rather shadowy and manipulative this was further demonstrated when cook was asked about apple s deal with google that keeps the search engine as the default on ios cook said he didn t remember the specific numbers if the ceo of one of the biggest tech companies in the world told you they forgot the specifics of a multibilliondollar decadelong deal with one of the other biggest tech companies in the world would you believe them apple search crawler activity could signal a google competitor or a bid to make siri a onestop shop little of the remaining testimony shed light on anything cook discussed the complexities of operating in places like china where local laws have technical and policy repercussions and minimized the assertion that apple had expanded the scope of inapp purchases and from which transactions the company gets a cut a bit more testimony will take place in a closed court but we likely won t hear about it as it will concern confidential information the trial which is winding down has held few surprises both sides laid out their arguments at the start and much of this will come down to the judge s interpretation of the facts there were no dramatic surprise witnesses or smoking guns it s simply a novel argument about what constitutes monopolistic behavior apple is adamant that competition is present and fierce in android and that in the gaming world it competes with windows and consoles as well it seems almost inevitable that whatever the judgment is the case will be appealed and brought to a higher court but that judgment will also be a strong indicator of how well epic s arguments and apple s obfuscations have been received that said epic and other critics of apple s app store fees which are immensely profitable however the company chooses to obscure it have arguably already accomplished their goals apple s lowered fee for the first million dollars is plainly a response to developer unrest and bad press and now it is put in the position of defending how the sausage gets made tarnishing apple s anodized aluminum tower was always at least partly the intent and win or lose epic may feel it has gotten its money s worth besides the rematch in europe is yet to come epic games takes its apple app store fight to europe,0.107,0.792,0.101,-0.8966,negative,1341

retain developers and users the fa ade of innocent ignorance began when he was asked about apple s r d numbers billion annually for the last three years specifically he said that apple couldn t estimate how much of that money was directed toward the app store because we don t allocate like that i e research budgets for individual products aren t broken out from the rest now that doesn t sound right does it a company like apple knows down to the penny how much it spends on its products and research even if it can t be perfectly broken down an advance in macos code may play into a feature on the app store the company must know to some extent how its resources are being deployed and to what effect the differences between a conservative and liberal estimation of the app store s r d allocation might be large in the hundreds of millions perhaps but make no mistake those estimations are almost certainly being made internally to do otherwise would be folly but because the numbers are not publicly declared and broken down and because they are likely to be somewhat fuzzy cook can say truthfully that there s no single number like to invent an amount app store r d was million in not having a hard number removes a potential foothold for epic which could use it either way if it s big they re protecting their golden goose enforcing market power if it s small they re just collecting the eggs collecting rent via market power apple s only winning move is not to play so cook plays dumb and consequently epic s argument looks like speculation and as apple would argue fabulation he then deployed a similar strategy of starving the competition with a preemptive shrug about profits he only addressed total net sales which were about billion at a profit margin saying apple does not evaluate the app store s income as a standalone business certainly it is arguable that the app store is very much a tightly integrated component of a larger business structure but the idea that it cannot be assessed as a standalone business is ludicrous it is again nearly certain that it like all of apple s divisions and product lines is dissected and reported internally in excruciating detail but again it is just plausible that for legal purposes it is not straightforward enough to say the income and profits of the app store are such and such thus denying epic its datum apple app store customers spent b over the week of christmas set a spending record on new year s day however the point is important enough that epic thought it warranted independent investigation and among the first things epic s attorney brought up when the witness was turned over to him was the testimony from earlier in the trial by an expert witness that apple s app store operating margins were around it was not in apple s interest to confirm or deny these numbers and cook again pleaded ignorance the mask slipped a tiny bit however when epic s attorney asked cook to break down the confidential income numbers that combined the mac and ios app stores while apple objected to this saying it was privileged information and could only be divulged in a closed court cook offered that the ios numbers are a lot larger than the mac numbers what we see here is another piece of financial sleightofhand by mixing the ios and mac income apple gets to muddy the waters of how much money is made and spent in and on them epic s attempt to unmix them was not successful but the judge is no fool she sees the same things epic does but just as dimly apple is attempting to deny epic a legal victory even at the cost of looking rather shadowy and manipulative this was further demonstrated when cook was asked about apple s deal with google that keeps the search engine as the default on ios cook said he didn t remember the specific numbers if the ceo of one of the biggest tech companies in the world told you they forgot the specifics of a multibilliondollar decadelong deal with one of the other biggest tech companies in the world would you believe them apple search crawler activity could signal a google competitor or a bid to make siri a onestop shop little of the remaining testimony shed light on anything cook discussed the complexities of operating in places like china where local laws have technical and policy repercussions and minimized the assertion that apple had expanded the scope of inapp purchases and from which transactions the company gets a cut a bit more testimony will take place in a closed court but we likely won t hear about it as it will concern confidential information the trial which is winding down has held few surprises both sides laid out their arguments at the start and much of this will come down to the judge s interpretation of the facts there were no dramatic surprise witnesses or smoking guns it s simply a novel argument about what constitutes monopolistic behavior apple is adamant that competition is present and fierce in android and that in the gaming world it competes with windows and consoles as well it seems almost inevitable that whatever the judgment is the case will be appealed and brought to a higher court but that judgment will also be a strong indicator of how well epic s arguments and apple s obfuscations have been received that said epic and other critics of apple s app store fees which are immensely profitable however the company chooses to obscure it have arguably already accomplished their goals apple s lowered fee for the first million dollars is plainly a response to developer unrest and bad press and now it is put in the position of defending how the sausage gets made tarnishing apple s anodized aluminum tower was always at least partly the intent and win or lose epic may feel it has gotten its money s worth besides the rematch in europe is yet to come epic games takes its apple app store fight to europe,0.107,0.792,0.101,-0.8966,negative,1341

our stories we may earn a commission this helps support our journalism learn more please also consider subscribing to wired unboxing the new inch imac isn t any different from the experience i went through last year when i tested apple s inch version of its allinone desktop computer yet the two machines feel poles apart maybe it s the fact that my partner and i spent a few minutes discussing which new imac color would look best in the bedroom maybe it s the sheer lightweight and slim nature of the machine or its many colormatching accessories it just looks so pretty i want to carve a space for it in my home the version of the pc marks the first major redesign apple has made to the imac in years it s just as simple to operate as before out of the box accessories like the keyboard and mouse are already paired to the machine all you need to do is find a space for the svelte body and plug in the magnetic power cord it s one of the easiest setup experiences around and forgive me for this oftused phrase it just works this approachability which is certainly amplified by the aesthetics is important as apple is touting this as a computer to be used by the whole family it s also the first imac with apple s own m processor and as we ve seen from other m machines the hardware is overall very reliable that said there are just a few quirks i hoped apple would ve addressed by now look at all the colors if you must know my partner and i decided the yellow imac would make a lovely contrast against our dark blue bedroom walls our second choice was purple which was the test unit apple sent my way it s just as nice honestly all tech should come in an array of colors that aren t black or white you can also opt for an imac in green pink orange silver or blue i thought the white trim around the screen and the large chin below the display which is where the computing components are housed would bother me but i don t mind them at all they lend to this imac s playful theme of looking and feeling nostalgic like the bondi blue imac of old without looking dated before i talk about the imac experience i need to note that the base model has many omissions that make it a little tough to recommend for your only choices are blue green pink or silver want the ability to connect an ethernet cable instead of relying on wonky wifi that option is an extra would you like the new magic keyboard that enables you to log in with touch id add more please biometric authentication shows up even in a iphone nowadays so it s baffling that these basic features aren t in the base model plus the cheapest model has only two usbc ports instead of the four that come in the version you ll definitely want to pay for touch id it s integrated into the topright part of the keyboard just like it is on macbooks and it makes logging in to the machine and all your favorite apps and services so much easier plus if you plan to add multiple accounts as you might want to do on a family computer each person just needs to hold their finger to the sensor to log in to their respective macos user profile the gigabit ethernet addon which is implemented into the power adapter is also worthwhile a hardwired internet connection is always more reliable apple imac inch rating if you buy something using links in our stories we may earn a commission this helps support our journalism learn more please also consider subscribing to wired with those upgrades oh and the magic trackpad instead of the awful magic mouse you still can t use as it charges your total is touch id ethernet and a good mouse shouldn t be addons at this point the model makes more sense because it includes ethernet and touch id plus more ports and an extra core for the graphics processing unit a total of with the upgrade to the trackpad in any case don t stick with the base imac customize your order and add these features the two other upgrades worth considering are storage and ram most folks may get by just fine with gigabytes of storage but you can add up to terabyte similarly the standard gigs of ram should be sufficient for most people but you should know that there are zero ways to upgrade ram in m macs if you re doing creative work with photos and videos pay the extra for gigabytes if not gb will more than satisfy though having more ram is always the safer option to futureproof your machine the m chip inside is the same as the one in the inch macbook pro air and the mac mini unlike the air the imac has a fan to dissipate heat so it can eke out and sustain a tiny bit more power for heavier workloads the fan rarely turned on in my experience and is very very quiet when it does switch on my benchmark tests show performance sitting smack dab between the air and the pro which makes sense considering the m here is powering a larger and higherresolution screen it s more power than most people need and that includes folks editing photos in photoshop and lightroom or editing k videos in adobe premiere and other videoediting software games like arkham city and transistor ran without hiccups and even if a great number of apps are now optimized for the m i haven t had any trouble with software written for intelbased machines the thing you ll be staring at the most the by pixel lcd screen looks great it can get blindingly bright colors look very natural and it s wonderfully sharp that said i split my time watching the ridiculously long snyder cut of justice league between the imac and the new ipad pro and i favored the experience on the latter apple s new mini led display tech in the ipad pro produces nicer contrasts with deeper blacks and brighter highlights but it s something i noticed only with both screens side by side as someone who usually uses an ultrawide monitor the inch screen on the imac feels cramped still i ve been able to make it work with safari front and center and slack and telegram readily accessible in the background note you can only natively connect one external display on m machines so if you wanted a triplescreen setup you ll need to look at thirdparty workarounds i do miss the nanotexture glass apple uses in the inch imac i had that machine set up in the same exact spot now occupied by the new imac and i never saw any glare that s not the case with this model it would ve been nice to have that glarefree glass as an optional addon for people who can only place their imac near a window apple imac inch rating if you buy something using links in our stories we may earn a commission this helps support our journalism learn more please also consider subscribing to wired a bigger annoyance arises when you realize you can t adjust the height of the screen you can only tilt the screen up toward your eyes by tugging the bottom edge forward that s not ideal for proper ergonomics the top of your computer s display should be set at eye level so being able to adjust the height is important i currently have the imac sitting on top of a stack of six books to boost the imac s screen to the correct height i am tall but i shouldn t have to suffer apple if you want to mount the whole imac to an adjustable arm and gain the freedom to move the screen anywhere you want you can but you have to buy the version that only comes with a vesa mount preinstalled and does not include apple s stand it s silly that you have to make this decision at checkout the webcam is the same p camera in the inch mac but apple says the m s image signal processor allows for better clarity noise reduction dynamic range and smarter exposure it would ve been nice to get a privacy shutter to round out those improvements but alas still the image quality is pretty good it s easily better than any other mac webcam my face comes up bright and colors don t look muted despite me sitting in a dimly lit bedroom i wouldn t go so far as to say it blew me away it still looks slightly lowres the bar for a good webcam is really low across the industry so i d have liked to see apple go further here and leapfrog the competition it s a similar story with the six speakers the bass is underwhelming but music and movies still sound great however too often i had the volume all the way up whether during a zoom meeting or when i was watching a show it can fill up my small bedroom but introduce some ambient noise like the drone of an air conditioner or the tv in the living room and you ll wish it could get louder the triplemic array on the other hand captures my voice really well good enough for the gadget lab podcast just make sure to remove the plastic wrap around the imac before joining your zoom meeting i didn t notice the thin layer of protective film when i was unboxing the machine and was very confused when my editor said i sounded awful days went by before i realized my mics were still covered the best part of using an imac comes when you pair it with other apple hardware it always feels like magic when i can copy text on my iphone and paste it on the imac thanks to the universal clipboard or when i load up a safari webpage on the imac and immediately open it on the ipad with just a tap then continue reading on the couch this kind of seamlessness is nearly unmatched on any other ecosystem whether everyone in the household uses an apple gadget or not the new imac is a great little machine that excels in its simplicity yes you can buy cheaper machines whether it s a windows allinone a pc you built or even by just hooking up the m powered mac mini to another monitor and peripherals but that all requires a bit of fussing you ll find little of that fussiness here it s just pure colorful bliss apple imac inch rating if you buy something using links in our stories we may earn a commission this helps

profile then view saved stories to revist this article visit my profile then view saved stories last fall canadian student colin madland noticed that twitter s automatic cropping algorithm continually selected his face not his darkerskinned colleague s from photos of the pair to display in tweets the episode ignited accusations of bias as a flurry of twitter users published elongated photos to see whether the ai would choose the face of a white person over a black person or if it focused on women s chests over their faces at the time a twitter spokesperson said assessments of the algorithm before it went live in found no evidence of race or gender bias now the largest analysis of the ai to date has found the opposite that twitter s algorithm favors white people over black people that assessment also found that the ai for predicting the most interesting part of a photo does not focus on women s bodies over women s faces previous tests by twitter and researcher vinay prabhu involved a few hundred images or fewer the analysis released by twitter research scientists wednesday is based on image pairs of people from different demographic groups to test whom the algorithm favors researchers found bias when the algorithm was shown photos of people from two demographic groups ultimately the algorithm picks one person whose face will appear in twitter timelines and some groups are better represented on the platform than others when researchers fed a picture of a black man and a white woman into the system the algorithm chose to display the white woman percent of the time and the black man only percent of the time the largest gap for any demographic groups included in the analysis for images of a white woman and a white man the algorithm displayed the woman percent of the time for images of a white woman and a black woman the algorithm displayed the white woman percent of the time on may twitter did away with image cropping for single photos posted using the twitter smartphone app an approach twitter chief design officer dantley davis favored since the algorithm controversy erupted last fall the change led people to post tall photos and signaled the end of open for a surprise tweets the socalled saliency algorithm is still in use on twitter com as well as for cropping multiimage tweets and creating image thumbnails a twitter spokesperson says excessively tall or wide photos are now center cropped and the company plans to end use of the algorithm on the twitter website saliency algorithms are trained by tracking what people look at when they look at an image other sites including facebook and instagram have used aibased automated cropping facebook did not respond to a request for comment accusations of gender and race bias in computer vision systems are unfortunately fairly common google recently detailed efforts to improve how android cameras work for people with dark skin last week the group algorithm watch found that imagelabeling ai used on an iphone labeled cartoon depictions of people with dark skin as animal an apple spokesperson declined to comment regardless of the results of fairness measurements twitter researchers say algorithmic decisionmaking can take choice away from users and have farreaching impact particularly for marginalized groups of people in the newly released study twitter researchers said they did not find evidence that the photo cropping algorithm favors women s bodies over their faces to determine this they fed the algorithm randomly chosen images of people identified as women and found that only three centered bodies over faces researchers suggest this is due to the presence of a badge or jersey numbers on people s chests to conduct the study researchers used photos from the wikiceleb dataset identity traits of people in the photos were taken from wikidata the twitter paper acknowledges that by limiting the analysis to black or white or male and female comparisons it can exclude people who identify as nonbinary or mixed race researchers said they had hoped to use the gender shades dataset created to assess the performance of facial recognition systems based on skin tone but licensing issues arose twitter published the study on the preprint repository arxiv a twitter spokesperson said it had been submitted to a research conference to be held in october twitter research scientists suggest that the racial bias found in the analysis may be a result of the fact that many images in the wikiceleb database have dark backgrounds and the saliency algorithm is drawn to the higher contrast of photos showing people with light skin against a dark background they also suggest that dark eye color on light skin played a role in saliency algorithms favoring people with light skin coauthors of the paper come from twitter s ml ethics transparency and accountability meta team which twitter launched last month rumman chowdhury founder of algorithm auditing startup parity and a former adviser to tech companies and governments directs the team in a blog post last month twitter said it created the team to take responsibility for twitter s use of algorithms provide transparency into internal decisionmaking about ai that impacts hundreds of millions of people and hold the company accountable some questions remain about how the meta team will operate such as who makes the final call about whether twitter uses certain kinds of ai the twitter spokesperson said crossfunctional teams decide what actions are taken on algorithms but did not address the question of who has final authority to decide when a form of ai is considered too unfair for use in the coming months meta plans to assess how the twitter home page recommendation algorithms treat certain racial groups and how twitter s ai treats people based on political ideologies the creation of the meta team came amid questions about the independence and viability of ethical ai teams in corporate environments in a move that has since led ai groups to turn down funding and thousands of googlers to revolt google and former ethical ai team lead timnit gebru parted ways in december in an interview shortly after chowdhury said the episode has consequences for responsible ai and the entire ai industry as chowdhury pointed out earlier this year there are many ways to define an algorithm audit what s not included in twitter s saliency research analysis of data used to train twitter s saliency algorithm or more detailed information about the analysis twitter carried out before the saliency algorithm came into use when asked how the twitter saliency controversy changed company policy a company spokesperson said that the company conducts risk assessments around privacy and

profile then view saved stories julian chokkattu to revist this article visit my profile then view saved stories to revist this article visit my profile then view saved stories if you can t beat em join em that s google s strategy for the ailing smartwatch platform it launched back in to better compete with the likes of apple google has a new threepronged plan to invigorate wear os and it involves partnerships with two brands it previously competed against in the wearable category samsung and fitbit first wear os will launch later this year as a unified platform codeveloped with samsung merging select features from the tizen operating system the korean company uses for its galaxy smartwatches that means future samsung watches will run wear instead of tizen second google will add more of its own apps to the wear platform and will update its existing apps to give them more robust capabilities finally wear s health and fitness features have been rebuilt from the ground up with input from samsung and fitbit respectively and fitbit wear smartwatches are on the way google completed its acquisition of fitbit earlier this year so now the wear team and the fitbit teams are under the same roof the announcement came at google io the company s annual developer conference the event is virtual for the first time ever joining a spate of other tech conferences that have avoided inperson gatherings for more than a year tiles are a carousel you can scroll through positioned next to the watch face now any thirdparty developer can make one originally named android wear when it first debuted in the wear os smartwatch platform has been made available by google for any watch manufacturer to use similar to the arrangement google has with smartphone manufacturers who want to use its android operating system but unlike android where a phonemaker can skin an android phone s software to match its brand companies using wear didn t have much control over the look and feel of the os there wasn t room to tailor the experience to any specific brand it s likely why samsung opted to go its own way and develop its own wearabledevice software after testing the waters with just one android wear smartwatch over the years google was slow to introduce new features to wear os and the number of manufacturer partners for the os dwindled samsung on the other hand saw success with its galaxy smartwatches despite the gamble of loading them up with its inhouse tizen os however tizen has its own weaknesses too namely the lack of available apps in samsung s bespoke app store for tizen wear os smartwatches may not have been popular but at least the platform has some desirable apps that brings us to the new unified software platform that google developed with samsung it s technically a new version of wear os although google hasn t yet decided on its name the company has dropped the os and has started calling it wear though a spokesperson says we ll see more finality on the name later this year more importantly this new version offers manufacturers more flexibility with hardware and software meaning a wear smartwatch s interface can be made to feel more consistent with a brand s smartphone and provide a more homogenous experience a googlemade reference user interface is also available for manufacturers that don t want to make any tweaks we think this will be great for the overall ecosystem says bj rn kilburn google s lead project manager on wear it ll be good for all devicemakers it ll be good for developers that we bring these two things together gear team lauren goode lily hay newman google also leveraged samsung s help in making wear more battery efficient most wear os smartwatches have historically lasted only a day or two before needing a recharge kilburn couldn t offer specifics about battery life gains which largely depend on the individual smartwatch but he says many of the workloads that need to run all the time on the watch like heartrate sensing have now been moved to more powerefficient environments in the hardware you ll soon be able to track your heart rate all day without killing the battery he says the platform runs more smoothly too kilburn cited up to percent faster performance with animations and transitions that look more fluid these tests are based on watches using the latest chipsets but google did not confirm if that meant it s been testing the qualcomm snapdragon wear processors that launched last year samsung uses its own exynos processors in its galaxy smartwatches so if wear is optimized for these chips it might mean more diversity in the smartwatch chipset market and a potential new revenue stream for samsung as the bulk of wear os smartwatches are powered by qualcomm some features from tizen os are going to be directly ported over to wear as well such as samsung s watch face designer tool it will be a part of wear later this year and many existing watch faces will make the jump with it that also means samsung will no longer make tizenpowered smartwatches its future galaxy smartwatches will run wear and the company says it will continue offering familiar experiences such as the popular rotating bezel that lets a user navigate the software interface without touching the screen the biggest benefit for samsung app support by nixing tizen kilburn says developers don t need to build apps for as many platforms and can largely focus on wear and apple s watchos just like how developers currently build mobile apps for android and ios thanks to some changes google has made in its development tools softwaremakers should now find it easier and faster to build wear apps kilburn says there will be a lot more investment and innovation coming to consumers in the form of apps jisun park corporate vice president and head of mobile platform and solutions at samsung research america echoed that sentiment in an email further collaboration with google also allows us to expand our ecosystem for developers and partners so that they can take the wearable experience to even greater heights park wrote as for existing galaxy smartwatches samsung says it s committed to providing galaxy store support and three years of software updates since the product s launch your existing health data can be exported to newer watches but more details will come at a later date the greater degree of customization in wear now afforded to manufacturers does come with a price the responsibility of delivering software updates it means new features from google for the platform may not be available to all wear smartwatches immediately similar to how new android features may or may not roll out to older android phones fragmentation has been a major problem with android as manufacturers have neglected to issue updates or have been slow to get around to them a selection of new designs of some apps in the new version of wear this shows offline listening in the youtube music app the recents menu to see recently opened apps turnbyturn navigation in google maps and a tile from the calm meditation app the apple watch comes with a host of applemade apps each of which offers similar functionality to its respective iphone app that s not the case with google s wear platform and it s a shortcoming the company is trying to fix kilburn says the team is rebuilding google s apps in wear with updated guidelines from material design the company s software design language that ensures apps look and behave in a way that s consistent this strategy will bring new features to the next generation of wear smartwatches that more closely match the features found in the respective apps on an android phone google maps for example will offer turnbyturn navigation in a new user interface that will also work even if your phone is not with you youtube music will finally debut on the platform and will include offline listening google says spotify will also add offline listening google pay support on wear is expanding to new countries bringing the total to and will feature a redesign many of these changes will arrive later this year alongside the launch of the new wear but some updates like a redesigned google assistant will come in early wear also has some new software navigation tricks a double press of a button will now instantly switch to a previously open app and a new recents menu lets you quickly hop back into recently used apps wear s tiles which are widgets that sit in a carousel next to the watch face and offer the type of information that can be soaked up with just a glance like the weather or your next calendar event are also getting an upgrade any thirdparty developer can now make one double tapping a button on a wear watch will now take you to the previous app another big reason google lags behind the smartwatch competition is its lackluster health and fitness portfolio in recent years apple has added electrocardiogram ecg and blood oxygen saturation spo measurements into its watches and rumors suggest blood glucose monitoring will be the next new health feature in the upcoming series smartwatch but google now owns fitbit and it s putting the wearable company s prowess in this area to use your next googlepowered smartwatch will come with many of the same features found on fitbit devices right now such as health tracking and workout progress as well as those onwrist celebrations that provide extra motivation fitbit will also produce premium smartwatches running wear in the future however features like ecg and spo aren t baked into wear natively any of those more specialized functionalities like the ecg will be up to the manufacturer kilburn says we ve enabled them to bring that kind of innovation to the marketplace so it would be up to the specific device launch both samsung and fitbit offer spo and ecg tracking on existing watches and trackers so it s likely though not confirmed that those functions will still be present when their respective wear watches debut later kilburn also says google has also worked with fitbit and samsung to rebuild the underlying health and fitness framework in wear to make activity tracking more accurate and to make it easier for developers to gather and use the tracking data in the past they d have to go all over the operating system to collect the different pieces of data but we re bringing them all into one framework they ll be able to use since fitbit s app will also land on wear future wear smartwatch owners can choose whether to use fitbit s app or google fit to track fitness data kilburn couldn t comment on future plans but says anyone who chooses a fitbit wear smartwatch will continue to have a great experience with fitbit as for future updates to wear kilburn didn t say if google will follow a yearly cycle of updates like it does with android or how apple debuts a new watchos version every year instead expect a more frequent cadence of updates it should be noted that while google announced that it closed its fitbit acquisition in january following approval from the european union s antitrust commission with conditions that google cannot use the health data of fitbit users for advertising and has to keep fitbit and google data separate it doesn t mean the us department of justice has automatically signed off on it a google spokesperson says it complied with the department s review and the agreed upon waiting period expired without their objection but the doj s review is still ongoing and it has enforcement tools it can utilize if it finds the acquisition harms competition nevertheless even though it s been seven years since google launched its smartwatch platform the company doesn t have much to show for it as of the fourth quarter of wear os counts for a measly percent of the market according to analysis firm counterpoint research apple saw a percent growth in global smartwatch sales in the same period and now commands percent of the market share samsung jumped to percent market share and fitbit was stagnant at percent google now owns that percent but it still needs samsung to grow the wear platform apple obviously dominates but samsung is the clear number two player says jeff fieldhack research director at counterpoint research they have brand recognition they sell by far the most connected devices which is kind of the trend also cellular connectivity by having a modem in it you can have a standalone device and don t need your companion smartphone fieldhack thinks there s a good chance that bringing samsung fitbit and even fashion brands such as fossil under the wear family will spur greater competition and renew developer interest in the platform like smartphones and tablets as you get higher volumes costs will go down and you ll get developers behind it more so the bigger numbers will definitely help wear os with samsung and fitbit set to debut new smartwatches and rumors of google making its own pixel smartwatch wear may finally be able to carve out a space in the market as a worthwhile competitor we really believe the smartwatch is a key step in the next evolution in mobile computing
