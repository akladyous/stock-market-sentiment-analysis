1,"Lady Gaga says she got pregnant at 19 after being raped by a music producer early in her career, a trauma that triggered a “total psychotic break.” Lady Gaga to LGBTQ community: 'I would take a bullet for you'  Lady Gaga says she got pregnant at 19 after being raped by a music producer early in her career, a trauma that triggered a “total psychotic break.” The singer-songwriter opened up about the ordeal on         Oprah Winfrey and Prince Harry’s Apple TV+ show “The Me You Can’t See,” which focuses on mental health. Lady Gaga, whose hits include “Born This Way” and “Shallow,” recalled having a “total psychotic break” years after she was raped. “For a couple years, I was not the same girl,” she said. Gaga said she was later diagnosed with PTSD after going to the hospital for chronic pain. The Grammy and Oscar-winner said the producer kept her “locked way” in a studio and threatened to burn her music if she didn’t take off her clothes, The singer refused to name the producer, explaining she doesn’t “ever want to face that person again.” Gaga first publicly told Howard Stern in a 2014 interview that she had been raped by a producer 20 years older than her, saying it inspired her 2013 track “Swine.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
2,"Stocks ended a wobbly day with mixed results on Wall Street BANGKOK -- Wall Street racked up more losses Friday on a choppy day of trading that left the major indexes mixed and the S&P 500 with its second straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 ended 0.1% lower after having been up 0.7% in the early going. The benchmark index, which hit an all-time high two weeks ago, lost 0.4% this week. That follows a 1.4% loss last week. Gains for banks and health care companies were kept in check by drops in technology stocks and in companies like Tesla, McDonald's and Amazon.com that rely directly on consumer spending. Energy stocks eked out a small gain as the price of U.S. crude oil rose. Treasury yields were mixed. The market's latest bout of selling come as investors remain focused on the possibility of inflation as the economy stirs to life following more than a year of shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The market is trying to digest signs of incipient inflation that may be more than transitory, with what the Fed’s reaction might be,” said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. The S&P 500 slipped 3.26 points to 4,155.86, while the Nasdaq slid 64.75 points, or 0.5%, to 13,470.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared better, gaining 123.69 points, or 0.4%, to 34,207.84. Small company stocks also notched gains. The Russell 2000 index picked up 7.51 points, or 0.3%, to 2,215.27. The market's pullback this month reflects heightened unease among traders that rising inflation may prompt central banks to pull back on their efforts to support job growth before the economic recovery is fully realized. The Federal Reserve has said it expects any bump in inflation to be temporary, though investors are uncertain about how hot inflation could become. Analysts have also said investors are looking further ahead, beyond the recovery, and wary about potential tax changes and the impact they may have on growth. The U.S. Treasury Department supports a         global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15% as part of an effort to end what it calls “a race to the bottom’’ as countries compete with each other to cut corporate tax rates and lure multinational companies. Solid earnings helped lift several companies Friday. Foot Locker rose 2% after reporting solid first-quarter earnings and revenue. Agricultural equipment maker Deere gained 1.3% after beating Wall Street’s fiscal second-quarter profit forecasts. Oatmilk maker         Oatly rose another 11.2%, following the 19% climb it made a day earlier on its first day of trading. Nvidia, the graphics card and chip manufacturer, rose 2.6% after the company announced a four-for-one stock split. Nvidia was one of the biggest gainers of 2020. Treasury yields were mostly stable. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.62% from 1.63% late Thursday. The price of Bitcoin also turned choppy following headlines out of China, where a government official said in a statement that the country is focused on cracking down on Bitcoin “mining and trading behavior.” Earlier this week, the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies fell sharply after China’s banking association issued a warning over the risks associated with digital currencies. The price of Bitcoin gave up 12% to about $35,412, according to crypto news and information site Coindesk. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
3,"Apple CEO Tim Cook will take the witness stand Friday to defend the company’s iPhone app store against charges that it has grown into an illegal monopoly — one far more profitable than his predecessor Steve Jobs ever envisioned SAN RAMON, Calif. -- Apple CEO Tim Cook will take the witness stand Friday to defend the company's iPhone app store against charges that it has grown into an illegal monopoly — one far more profitable than his predecessor Steve Jobs envisioned when it opened up 13 years ago. The technology company is counting on Cook's appearance to put the finishing touches on Apple's defense against an antitrust case brought by Epic Games, maker of the popular video game Fortnite. Epic is trying to topple the so-called “walled garden"" for iPhone and iPad apps that welcomes users and developers while keeping competition out. Created by Jobs a year after the iPhone's 2007 debut, the App Store has become a key revenue source for Apple, a money-making machine that helped power the company to a $57 billion profit in its last fiscal year. Epic is trying to prove that the store has morphed into a price-gouging vehicle that not only reaps a 15% to 30% commission from in-app transactions, but blocks apps from offering other payment alternatives. That extends to just showing a link that would open a web page offering commission-free ways to pay for subscriptions, in-game items and the like. Apple fiercely defends the commissions as a fair way for app makers to help pay for innovations and security controls that have benefited both iPhone users and app developers, including Epic. Apple says it has invested more than $100 billion in such features. It also argues that App Store commissions mirror fees charged by major video game consoles — Sony's PlayStation, Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo's Switch — as well as a similar app store run by Google for more than 3 billion mobile Android devices. That is roughly twice the number of active iPhones, iPads and iPods that rely on Apple's store for apps. Apple's ironclad control over the App Store is already under investigation by regulators and lawmakers in Europe and the U.S. Epic lawyers are expected to spend several hours grilling Cook on the stand. The questioning is likely to dissect the strategies Cook has drawn up since taking the CEO job nearly a decade ago, just a few months before Jobs died of cancer in October 2011. The App Store ranks among Apple's biggest successes during Cook's reign. Since beginning with just 500 apps in 2008 the store has ballooned to 1.8 million apps, most of which are free. Apple has drawn upon its commissions and exclusive in-app payment system to help more than double the annual revenue of its services division from $24 billion in fiscal 2016 to $54 billion last year. This boom wasn't something Jobs foresaw. Shortly after the store opened, Jobs publicly said Apple didn't expect the App Store to be very lucrative. Epic's lawyers have repeatedly cited those comments as evidence that Apple reshaped the store to fuel its earnings growth once the popularity of mobile apps became clear. Exactly how profitable the App Store is has been a point of contention throughout the three-week trial. An accounting expert hired by Epic estimated that its profit margins range from 70% to 80%, based on a review of confidential Apple documents. But Apple has insisted those numbers aren't accurate because they don't reflect expenses spread throughout the company's operations. Phil Schiller, a longtime Apple executive and former Jobs confidant, conceded earlier this week that the company's commission system had generated more than $20 billion in revenue through June 2017. Epic lawyer Katherine Forrest had presented him with that estimate, based on numbers that         Apple publicly released  in mid-2017. Epic's questioning of Schiller may foreshadow how Epic's lawyers intend to go after Cook, who is generally unflappable in public and tightly focused on his message when dealing with reporters and lawmakers. Epic's lawyers have repeatedly referred to internal exchanges involving Jobs and other executives to depict Apple as using its investment in security and personal privacy as an excuse for preserving the huge profits that flow from its app store. During Schiller's testimony, for instance, Epic's lawyers submitted a 2008 email Jobs sent to Schiller and another executive. In that note, Jobs wondered whether Google was taking aim at the then-nascent ad market that was emerging on the iPhone, which relies on operating software called iOS. “The more energy they devote to iOS the better,"" Jobs wrote to Schiller. Forrest then challenged Schiller with two questions. “You wanted Google to be beholden to Apple?"" she asked, soon following with, “You were basking in the power to destroy a company's business?"" Schiller answered no to both questions. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

7,"A new Apple TV+ series makes the case, at some length, that 1971 was a landmark year in how popular music reflected the tumultuous times NEW YORK -- Chrissie Hynde wouldn't make her own mark in music until a few years later, but her memories of how 1971's daily soundtrack was tied to the times remain vivid. “Music said something,” the Pretenders' leader and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member says at the start of         “1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything,” an eight-part documentary series that premieres Friday on the Apple TV+ streaming service. Hynde had just dropped out of Kent State University in Ohio, where a year earlier four students were shot and killed by the National Guard. Neil Young's incendiary song about the incident, “Ohio,” played as she told her story. Her three words essentially provide the theme statement for the series' producers. They document, through indelible work made that year by Marvin Gaye, Carole King, John Lennon and many others, how musicians responded at a time when the 1960s dream was dying and it was unclear what would replace it. “Some people run away and hide themselves in drugs,” said James Gay-Rees, one of the series' executive producers. “Some people write protest music and some people find their identity. It's such a brilliant tipping point, really.” It was the year of Gaye's “What's Going On,” No. 1 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the top 500 albums of all time. Joni Mitchell's “Blue.” King's “Tapestry.” Lennon's “Imagine.” The Rolling Stones' “Sticky Fingers.” Sly & the Family Stone's “There's a Riot Goin' On.” David Bowie's hit “Changes.” Gil Scott-Heron's song that became a catchphrase, “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.” Gay-Rees was 4 years old at the time. It took three years to make the series, mostly because of the arduous task of securing rights to about 150 pieces of music, after he was intrigued by the David Hepworth book, “1971 — Never a Dull Moment: Rock's Golden Year."" After a somewhat unfocused first episode, the series settles in with more thematic subsequent pieces. One episode focuses on King and Mitchell and the breaking down of sexual barriers, while “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised” zeroes in on Black musicians and how they addressed issues like poverty and treatment by authorities with work that sounds fresh today. Gay-Rees said he wanted to avoid the look of traditional music documentaries, with shots of creators sitting in control rooms talking about why they added this instrument or that beat. Instead, songwriting is talked about in the context of the times, so the series feels as much about the history of the year as the music. “You can't really make a film about John Lennon writing ‘Imagine’ without asking why he wrote ‘Imagine,’"" he said. Besides the crucial music clearances, producers deserve credit for all of the video they dug up, including film of Lennon, producer Phil Spector and musicians recording the “Imagine” album. In another priceless clip, President Richard Nixon introduces a performance by the Ray Conniff Singers at the White House by saying, “if the music is square, it's because I like it square.” Nixon keeps a frozen smile as one of the singers holds up a sign protesting the Vietnam War. Similarly, the “Revolution” episode contains brutal footage of the Attica Prison riot with a discussion of Aretha Franklin's participation in a benefit for victims. Other topics include the emergence of glam rock in the aftermath of the Beatles' breakup, how James Brown and other Black artists fought against racism, the rise of hard drugs and how it affected artists like the Rolling Stones and Sly Stone, and how George Harrison's “Concert for Bangla Desh” provided a template for future benefits. While Gay-Rees said he's “not prone to nostalgia,” it's hard to dismiss the quality of the songwriting. Was it the best year ever for popular music? “You can argue whether it was ‘66 or 1950 or ’71,” he said. “But it was a pretty good year by anybody's measure.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Today’s Highlight in History: On May 20, 1927, Charles Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field on Long Island, New York, aboard the Spirit of St. Louis on his historic solo flight to France. On this date: In 1506, explorer Christopher Columbus died in Spain. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead Act, which was intended to encourage settlements west of the Mississippi River by making federal land available for farming. In 1932, Amelia Earhart took off from Newfoundland to become the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. (Because of weather and equipment problems, Earhart set down in Northern Ireland instead of her intended destination, France.) In 1948, Chiang Kai-shek (chang ky-shehk) was inaugurated as the first president of the Republic of China (Taiwan). In 1956, the United States exploded the first airborne hydrogen bomb over Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. In 1959, nearly 5,000 Japanese-Americans had their U.S. citizenships restored after choosing to renounce them during World War II. In 1961, a white mob attacked a busload of Freedom Riders in Montgomery, Alabama, prompting the federal government to send in U.S. marshals to restore order. In 1978, Japan’s Narita International Airport began operations after years of protests over its construction by local residents. In 1985, Radio Marti, operated by the U.S. government, began broadcasting; Cuba responded by attempting to jam its signal. In 1995, President Bill Clinton announced that the two-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House would be permanently closed to motor vehicles as a security measure. In 2009, suspended NFL star Michael Vick was released after 19 months in prison for running a dogfighting ring to begin two months’ home confinement. In 2015, four of the world’s biggest banks — JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup’s banking unit Citicorp, Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland — agreed to pay more than $5 billion in penalties and plead guilty to rigging the currency markets. Ten years ago: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the idea of using his country’s 1967 boundaries as the basis for a neighboring Palestinian state, declaring his objections during a face-to-face meeting with President Barack Obama, who had raised the idea in an effort to revive stalled Mideast peace talks. Randy “Macho Man” Savage, 58, a larger-than-life personality from professional wrestling’s 1980s heyday, died in Pinellas County, Florida. Five years ago: A U.S. Secret Service officer shot a man with a gun who had approached a checkpoint outside the White House and refused to drop his weapon; Jesse Olivieri of Ashland, Pennsylvania, was later sentenced to eight months’ confinement. One year ago: President Donald Trump threatened to hold up federal funds for two election battleground states (Michigan and Nevada) that were making it easier to vote by mail during the pandemic. Police ticketed seven people for cutting hair during a protest against coronavirus restrictions outside the Michigan Capitol, where about a dozen barbers and hair stylists defied stay-at-home orders to give free haircuts. Apple and Google released smartphone technology that could notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus. Former Green Beret Michael Taylor and his son Peter were arrested in Massachusetts on charges that they had smuggled Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn from Japan to Lebanon in a box as he faced financial misconduct charges.

9,"Apple CEO Tim Cook will take the witness stand on Friday in a high-stakes courtroom battle SAN RAMON, Calif -- Apple CEO Tim Cook will take the witness stand this Friday in a high-stakes courtroom battle over the lucrative commissions the iPhone maker has been raking in from its mobile app store. The timing of Cook's highly anticipated testimony was confirmed Wednesday when a federal judge granted Apple's request to allow the 60-year-old executive to be the first witness sworn in Friday morning during         a trial that has been unfolding  in an Oakland, California, courtroom since the beginning of this month. The trial revolves around an antitrust lawsuit filed last year by Epic Games, the maker of the popular video game Fortnite. Epic is trying prove that commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on transactions in apps installed on iPhones, iPads and iPods are part of a monopoly that Apple has created around a fortress blocking other payment options on its mobile devices. Apple has brushed off the allegations as a desperate attempt by Epic to boost its own profits by breaching a contract covering a system that requires a small portion of the 1.8 million apps in its store to pay the commissions on transactions. Apple says the commissions help it pay for the technology powering its products, including the security and privacy protections that has helped make iPhone so popular. Cook will be taking the stand as Apple prepares to wrap its case before the two sides make their closing arguments and answer U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' questions about the evidence on Monday. His appearance also will serve as a sort of bookend to the testimony of Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, who took the stand for two days during the first two days of trial. The CEOs' testimony could be a study in contrasts. Cook has emerged as a polished, confident public speaker since inheriting his CEO job nearly a decade ago from Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs. But Sweeney is far more soft spoken, and often had to be asked to speak up during his testimony that         at times included statements  that seemed to bolster Apple's defense. Cook will also have the advantage of listening to how Epic's lawyers have been grilling Apple executives who have been taking the stand. That list has included Phil Schiller, Apple's former marketing guru and a Jobs confidant who was on the stand Monday and Tuesday. Apple's software chief, Craig Federighi, took the stand Wednesday to discuss the various ways the company insulates its products from hackers.

10,"Apple CEO Tim Cook will take the witness stand on Friday in a high-stakes courtroom battle SAN RAMON, Calif -- Apple CEO Tim Cook will take the witness stand this Friday in a high-stakes courtroom battle over the lucrative commissions the iPhone maker has been raking in from its mobile app store. The timing of Cook's highly anticipated testimony was confirmed Wednesday when a federal judge granted Apple's request to allow the 60-year-old executive to be the first witness sworn in Friday morning during         a trial that has been unfolding  in an Oakland, California, courtroom since the beginning of this month. The trial revolves around an antitrust lawsuit filed last year by Epic Games, the maker of the popular video game Fortnite. Epic is trying prove that commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on transactions in apps installed on iPhones, iPads and iPods are part of a monopoly that Apple has created around a fortress blocking other payment options on its mobile devices. Apple has brushed off the allegations as a desperate attempt by Epic to boost its own profits by breaching a contract covering a system that requires a small portion of the 1.8 million apps in its store to pay the commissions on transactions. Apple says the commissions help it pay for the technology powering its products, including the security and privacy protections that has helped make iPhone so popular. Cook will be taking the stand as Apple prepares to wrap its case before the two sides make their closing arguments and answer U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' questions about the evidence on Monday. His appearance also will serve as a sort of bookend to the testimony of Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, who took the stand for two days during the first two days of trial. The CEOs' testimony could be a study in contrasts. Cook has emerged as a polished, confident public speaker since inheriting his CEO job nearly a decade ago from Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs. But Sweeney is far more soft spoken, and often had to be asked to speak up during his testimony that         at times included statements  that seemed to bolster Apple's defense. Cook will also have the advantage of listening to how Epic's lawyers have been grilling Apple executives who have been taking the stand. That list has included Phil Schiller, Apple's former marketing guru and a Jobs confidant who was on the stand Monday and Tuesday. Apple's software chief, Craig Federighi, took the stand Wednesday to discuss the various ways the company insulates its products from hackers. The specter of Jobs is likely to be raised while Cook is on the stand, based on Epic's strategy in the so far.

12,"Shares are mixed in Asia after benchmarks closed broadly lower on Wall Street in a third day of retreat BANGKOK -- Shares were mixed in Asia on Thursday after benchmarks closed broadly lower on Wall Street in a third day of retreat. The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies declined further. Stocks rose in Tokyo and Sydney but fell in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Japan's government reported that exports rose 38% in April from a year earlier while imports climbed nearly 13%, indicating a recovery in overseas demand even as the country weathers its worst bout of coronavirus outbreaks so far. Exports to the U.S. rose 45% while those to China jumped nearly 34% in a strong rebound after last year's shocks from lockdowns and other precautions taken to curb the pandemic. The Nikkei 225 regained lost ground, edging 0.2% higher to 28,067.53, while Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 surged 0.9% to 6,993.90. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng skidded 0.7% to 28,381.13 while Seoul's Kospi declined 0.5% to 3,157.70. Shares rose in Singapore and Jakarta but fell in Taiwan. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 index dropped 0.3% to 4,115.68 after recovering from a 1.6% slide earlier in the day. The benchmark index is on track for its second weekly loss in a row. Bank stocks were among the biggest decliners. Goldman Sachs fell 1.7% and Wells Fargo lost 1.5%. Retailers and other companies that rely directly on consumer spending also pulled the market lower. Home Depot slid 0.7%, Gap fell 3% and L Brands dropped 3.1%. Energy sector stocks, the biggest gainers so far this year, bore the heaviest losses as the price of U.S. crude oil skidded 3.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5% to 33,896.04. The Nasdaq fared better than the rest of the market, shedding less than 0.1%, to 13,299.74. Smaller company stocks also lost ground. The Russell 2000 index lost 0.8%, to 2,193.64. Digital currencies fell sharply after China’s banking association issued a warning Wednesday over the risks associated with digital currencies. Bitcoin’s price was down 6.2% to $38,140, well below its all-time high of over $64,800 reached a month ago, according to the crypto news site Coindesk. It swung in a huge range of as low as $30,202 and as high as $43,621 over the course of the day. That the headline out of China rattled crypto investors suggests the market was already weak, said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “If Bitcoin had been holding up better, a headline like that would be dismissed more readily, but it comes at a time when Bitcoin was already well off its highs,” he said. “It gave people who were looking for a reason to sell cover.” The Bitcoin skid comes after longtime Bitcoin advocate Tesla recently recently said it would no longer accept Bitcoin as payment for its cars, reversing its earlier position. The selling was so intense that the web site of Coinbase, an online brokerage for digital currencies, was temporarily down in the morning. Coinbase's stock dropped 5.9%, ending about 34% below the peak it reached on April 16, just two days after its IPO. Investors continue to focus on whether         rising inflation will be temporary or whether it will endure.         Prices are rising for everything from gasoline to food as the economy recovers from its more than year-long malaise. The fear is that the Federal Reserve will have to dial back its extensive support if inflation persists. That includes record-low interest rates and the monthly purchase of $120 billion in bonds meant to goose the job market and economy. The minutes from the central bank’s April meeting of policymakers, which were released Wednesday afternoon, reaffirmed the view that the Fed’s decision to keep its benchmark interest rate ultra-low remains the best policy approach, though some officials cautioned that some factors pushing inflation higher may not be resolved quickly. Treasury yields mostly rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 1.66% from 1.67% late Wednesday. In other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil added 11 cents to $63.46 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It dropped $2.50 on Wednesday to $63.35 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard for pricing, rose 9 cents to $66.75 per barrel. The dollar fell to 109.14 Japanese yen from 109.23 yen on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.2185 from $1.2174. ——— AP Business writers Alex Veiga and Damian J. Troise contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
13,"Chinese online nationalism has a new target: Netflix and its popular Thai drama “Girl from Nowhere.” On Location: May 20, 2021 BEIJING -- Chinese nationalism on the internet has a new target: Netflix and its popular Thai drama “Girl from Nowhere.” Comments online Wednesday complained the series’ Facebook page showed the flags of Taiwan, the island democracy claimed by the ruling Communist Party as part of its territory, and of Hong Kong, where the party is trying to crush pro-democracy activism. Netflix joins a growing list of foreign retailers, airlines, hotels and other companies that have been attacked online in China over Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet, human rights and other politically charged issues. Some comments complained the flags show support for “splitting China,” or promoting formal independence for self-ruled Taiwan. The flags, with the those of Singapore and other markets, appear beside “Thank You"" in local languages for the series' popularity. The advertisement says nothing about whether they represent countries. “This is a (profanity) split!” said a comment signed Tang Sugar Sugar Tang 123 on the popular Sina Weibo social media service. “Does China need to say thank you for this? Bah! This is a blatant split!” “Nanno I like you a lot, but sorry, you crossed my line. Goodbye,” said another comment on Sina Weibo signed Huadu, referring the series’ main character. “Think clearly about what kind of country China is before getting benefits from us.” Netflix didn’t respond to questions left on its website. The outcry highlights China’s unusual mix of nationalism and pervasive censorship. The ruling party increasingly demands global companies conform in public to Beijing's political positions, including on websites abroad that the ruling party's internet filters block most people in China from seeing. Facebook can be seen in China only by people with virtual private network software used to evade the filters. “Girl from Nowhere” can be seen in China on bilibili.com, which allows users to upload their own videos. It doesn’t appear on other services that show movies and TV series approved by Chinese censors. It wasn’t clear how many people have watched “Girl from Nowhere,” but Douban.com, a website for users to leave reviews, says more than 60,000 people have commented on the first season and 30,000 on the second. The average rating is 8.4 points out of 10, which is unusually high. The Global Times, a newspaper published by the ruling party, showed the offending advertisement on its website but that image didn’t appear on other Chinese sites or in the newspaper's Chinese-language edition. The ruling party says Taiwan must unite with the mainland and has threatened to invade if it tries to make its independence official. Beijing has menaced the island this year by sending fighters and bombers on flights close to and around Taiwan. In Hong Kong, the party is trying to crush pro-democracy sentiment following protests that began in 2019. Advocates including tycoon Jimmy Lai, whose company publishes the pro-democracy Apple Daily tabloid, have been sentenced to prison. In March, the ruling party lashed out at H&M, Adidas, Nike and other foreign retailers and shoe brands in an attempt to pressure them into rejecting reports of forced labor and other abuses in Xinjiang in China’s northwest. State media called for a boycott of H&M after the ruling party’s youth wing publicized the Swedish retailer’s statement from early 2020 saying it no longer would use cotton from Xinjiang. ——— AP researchers Fu Ting in Bangkok, Chen Si in Shanghai and Yu Bing in Beijing contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

15,"More than a year after coronavirus shutdowns sent “the city that never sleeps” into a fitful slumber, New York could soon be wide awake again Former acting director of the CDC discusses states dropping mask mandates NEW YORK -- More than a year after coronavirus shutdowns sent “the city that never sleeps” into a fitful slumber, New York could be wide awake again this summer. Starting Wednesday, vaccinated New Yorkers         can shed their masks  in most situations, and restaurants, stores, gyms and many other businesses can go back to full capacity if they check vaccination cards or apps for proof that all patrons have been inoculated. Subways resumed running round-the-clock this week. Midnight curfews for bars and restaurants will be gone by month's end. Broadway tickets are         on sale again, though the curtain won't rise on any shows until September. Officials say now is New York's moment to shake off the image of a city brought to its knees by the virus last spring — a recovery poignantly rendered on the latest cover of The New Yorker magazine. It shows a giant door part-open to the city skyline, letting in a ray of light. Is the Big Apple back to its old, brash self? “Maybe 75%. ... It’s definitely coming back to life,” said Mark Kumar, 24, a personal trainer. But Ameen Deen, 63, said: “A full sense of normalcy is not going to come any time soon. There's far too many deaths. There's too much suffering. There's too much inequality."" Last spring, the biggest city in America was also the nation's deadliest coronavirus hotspot, the site of over 21,000 deaths in just two months. Black and Hispanic patients have died at markedly higher rates than whites and Asian Americans. Hospitals overflowed with patients and corpses. Refrigerated trailers served as         temporary morgues,  and         tents were set up in Central Park as a COVID-19 ward. New York's hectic streets fell quiet, save for ambulance sirens and nightly bursts of cheering from apartment windows for health care workers. After a year of ebbs, surges, reopenings and closings, the city hopes vaccinations are turning the tide for good. About 47% of residents have had at least one dose so far. Deaths have amounted to about two dozen a day in recent weeks, and new cases and hospitalizations have plummeted from a wintertime wave. Large swaths of the country and world are also starting to get back to normal after a crisis blamed for 3.4 million deaths globally, including more than 587,000 in the U.S. Las Vegas casinos are returning to 100% capacity and no social distancing requirements. Disneyland in California opened up late last month after being shuttered for more than 400 days. Massachusetts this week announced that all virus restrictions will expire Memorial Day weekend. Summer music festivals like Lollapalooza are back on, the Indy 500 is bracing for more than 100,000 fans, and the federal government says fully vaccinated adults no longer need to wear masks. France is opening back up on Wednesday as well, with the Eiffel Tower, Parisian cafes and cinemas and the Louvre bringing back visitors for the first time in months. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has declared it the “summer of New York City.” There are other signs New York is regaining its bustle. Some 80,000 city employees returned to their offices at least part time this month, joining the many municipal workers whose jobs never were done remotely. Subway and commuter rail ridership is averaging about 40% of normal after plunging to 10% last spring, when the         subway system began closing for several hours overnight  for the first time in its more than 115-year history. Shakeem Brown, an artist and delivery person who works late in Manhattan, spent up to three hours a night commuting back to his Queens apartment before 24/7 service resumed Monday. Brown, 26, said it's “refreshing” to see things opening up. At e's Bar on Manhattan's Upper West Side, “we feel the energy” of social life ramping up, co-owner Erin Bellard said. “People are so excited to be out.” Still, receipts at the bar and grill have been down about 35% because of pandemic restrictions on hours and capacity, she said. The impending end of the midnight curfew will give the bar two more crucial hours, and the owners are planning to survey patrons to determine whether to regain full capacity by requiring vaccinations. From other vantage points, “normal” looks farther off. The sidewalks and skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan, for instance, are still noticeably empty. Big corporate employers largely aren't looking to bring more workers back until fall, and only if they feel it's safe, said Kathryn Wylde, CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a major employers group. “Shutting down was easy. Reopening is hard,"" Wylde said after a meeting last week with a group of CEOs. ""All the employers say that there still is fear and some resistance to coming back.” Besides virus fears, companies and workers are wondering about safety, she said. Crime in the city has become a growing source of concern, but it's a complicated picture. Murders, shootings, felony assaults and auto thefts rose in the first four months of this year compared with the same period in pre-pandemic 2019, but robberies and grand larcenies fell. So did crime in the transit system, probably because of the drop in ridership. Brandon Goldgrub has been back at his midtown office since July, but it's just in the last few weeks that he has noticed the sidewalks seem a bit crowded again. “Now I feel it's a lot more normal,” said Goldgrub, 30, a property manager. Visiting from Tallahassee, Florida, Jessica Souva looked around midtown and felt hopeful about the city where she used to live. “All we heard, elsewhere in the country, was that New York was a ghost town, and this doesn't feel like that,” said Souva, 47. “It feels like a city in transition.” ——— Associated Press writer Michael R.

19,"John Kraskinski writes and directs the sequel to his nearly silent thriller “A Quiet Place,” although this time he only cameos in a flashback John Krasinski shares what inspired him to create ‘A Quiet Place Part II’ John Krasinski catches you off guard in the first moment of “         A Quiet Place Part II,” inviting you into his film with the most terrifying thing of all in this universe: Noise. It’s a testament to the effectiveness of “A Quiet Place” that any sound is guaranteed to make you immediately uneasy: The crinkle of a bag, the crunch of an apple, a car door closing. Krasinski begins the sequel, which he wrote and directed, in a flashback to the day the monsters arrived, and boy, are we LOUD. It’s a bit of a gut punch, and not just because he doesn’t waste any time before getting to action. We know he and others won’t be around when the film cuts to the present. And you might be surprised how far just a little glimpse of their pre-disaster happiness goes when it comes to reminding you what they’ve lost and what they’re trying to hang on to. And this one picks up right where we left off. Emily Blunt’s character, Evelyn, has not had time to go full Sarah Connor in “A Quiet Place Part II.” Like John Wick, the Abbotts don’t get a breather. And she and her family — a newborn, her son Marcus (Noah Jupe) and daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds) — are on the move to find somewhere else to stay. They’ve rigged up a terrifying coffin-like box for the infant with an oxygen tank and a baby breathing apparatus so that they can move without worrying about the baby’s cries. Clearly it’s been mostly thought out by people who are actually parents themselves, but it’s better if you don’t ask too many questions about the logistics of all of this. Suffice it to say, the introduction of the baby ensures that your stomach will never not be in knots throughout the lean duration of the film. Krasinski makes one choice with the baby that borders on indecent, but it’s terribly effective. It is somewhat astonishing that they were able to find enough new in this world to justify a full sequel, but unfortunately for everyone Regan’s inspired hack to stun the monsters using high frequency sounds is only effective in the immediate surroundings. In other words, there are a lot more out there. The family does find another place and a once-friendly face, in Cillian Murphy’s Emmett. But like so many of Murphy’s characters, it’s unclear whether or not he can be trusted and he doesn’t seem like he wants to help. Blunt, Simmonds and Jupe are all once again terrific in their roles, using sign language and their expressive, empathetic faces to brilliantly convey terror, love and pain. The nail also reprises its role and is just as effective at creating tension as before, but Krasinski unfortunately has something more brutal in store for one of the Abbotts. But the reason these films work is not because of the scares. They work because, at their heart, they are a high concept meditation on parenting. Sure, the surprises keep your heart rate up and all that but the true terror, the one that buries itself in your consciousness, comes from that deep, intractable fear of not being able to protect your kids. Many monster movies boldly claim to be about something bigger and rarely are. These films succeed at that. After being delayed more than a year, “A Quiet Place Part II” is debuting only in theaters for the first 45 days, until it’s made available on Paramount+, and it might sound cliché, but it’s hard to imagine seeing it anywhere but on the big screen. It’s the kind of movie that demands it. “A Quiet Place Part II,” a Paramount Pictures release in theaters May 28, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for “terror, violence and bloody/disturbing images.” Running time: 97 minutes. Three stars out of four. —- MPAA Definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned.

In the early days of the internet, it seemed like there were thousands of free email service providers. Since then, a select few have dominated the space thanks to their reliable features, customizable interfaces, and extensive storage options.  While Google's Gmail and Microsoft's Outlook stand above the rest in terms of well-rounded, accessible features, there are a couple outliers users should consider depending on their email needs.  Gmail is an obvious choice for many reasons: It's free, customizable, and gives users access to the full Google Workspace (formerly known as G Suite). More than a billion people use Gmail across the world.  Here are the features that make Gmail stand out: While Gmail has a highly customizable interface and sleek design, its labeling system could use some work. Users often have to customize labels and manually filter emails into folders, rather than the service doing it intuitively.  Microsoft Outlook has such a vast array of features that can either be incredibly useful, or overwhelming to those who want a simpler email service. Like Gmail, Outlook integrates with other Microsoft programs like Office, OneDrive, Skype, Calendar, PayPal, and DocuSign.  Here are the features that make Outlook stand out:  Unlike Gmail, Outlook's template for automatic email replies is restrictive and doesn't offer many options. However, it's ability to filter, label, and find emails puts it a notch above the rest.  Most Apple users know about iCloud's email service, but don't have one. The good news is you can set up an iCloud email account in a few minutes. iCloud's email service is for anyone looking for a no-frills option that can accomplish basic email functions without much fuss.  Here are the features that make iCloud stand out: The biggest downside of iCloud's email service is that you must have an Apple device to get full access to all its features. An iCloud email account also doesn't have the ability to schedule send emails, snooze emails for later, or access email offline. However, if you have an Apple ID, signing up for iCloud is the easiest, quickest way to get an email address.  Users who are looking for the epitome of email security should look no further than ProtonMail. ProtonMail's mission is to provide users with the privacy and security, which has made it a favorite among journalists and government figures. All emails are automatically encrypted unless otherwise selected, making it the best choice for anyone looking to ensure the security of their correspondence, but who can also overlook the service's lack of extra features.  Here are the features that make ProtonMail stand out:  There are a few downsides to using ProtonMail, like only being able to send up to 150 messages per day. And at just 500MB, it's free email storage is abysmal compared to other services. There's also no way to filter messages into more than three folders. Don't cast Yahoo Mail aside just yet. Yahoo has been around longer than many of the other email providers, but doesn't get enough credit for its features and hefty storage options. In recent years, Yahoo has scrapped the flashy, page-length advertisements for a more robust, polished email interface that resembles its competitors.  Here are the features that make Yahoo stand out:  Yahoo's biggest downfall is it can, at times, be buggy and slow. Creating filters isn't as intuitive as other competitors, making organization time-consuming. However, if you want to add Yahoo Mail to the mix, the app makes it easy to integrate your other inboxes (Gmail, AOL, Outlook) all in one place. "

Business figures are split on Apple as CEO Tim Cook testifies in an antitrust trial focused on the App Store. In separate interviews with CNBC on Friday, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Expedia Chairman Barry Diller came out swinging for and against, respectively, Apple as Cook took the stand. Diller criticized Apple for using its ""quasi-monopoly"" to overcharge companies like his in ""a disgusting manner"" through its App Store commissions. The company requires developers to pay a 30% fee on purchases made in the marketplace, and many have long seen the practice as a way for Apple to obtain an unfair advantage in the market.  ""The idea that they actually justify it by saying, 'We spend all this money protecting our little App Store,'"" Diller told CNBC. ""I mean, it's criminal. Well, it will be criminal."" Spiegel later spoke with the outlet and said Snap is ""happy"" to pay the 30% commission fee on in-app purchases. ""We really feel like Snapchat wouldn't exist without the iPhone and without the amazing platform that Apple has created,"" Spiegel said. ""In that sense, I'm not sure we have a choice about paying the 30% fee, and of course, we're happy to do it in exchange for all of the amazing technology that they provide to us in terms of the software but also in terms of their hardware advancements."" Snap and Expedia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Read more: The App Store is Apple's most valuable asset, but also its biggest liability Cook's Friday appearance on the stand comes as part of a trial that began earlier this month in California, prompted by a conflict between Apple and ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games last summer. Apple pulled the wildly popular ""Fortnite"" from its App Store in 2020 after Epic skirted the company's rules and fees to add its own in-app payment system. Epic has argued that Apple's App Store is a monopoly, while Apple says Epic simply broke the rules that govern its developers. The trial is expected to conclude on Monday, and its results could majorly impact Apple's business."

The pandemic expedited wearable technology adoption and heightened the role it plays in healthcare. Wearables usage was already rising pre-pandemic as consumers gravitated to the idea of monitoring their own health, and it continued to skyrocket in 2020 as newer devices came into the market, with enhanced features focusing on health. According to our estimates, more than one-fifth of the US population is expected to use a smart wearable device this year, as the behavior to monitor health amid the pandemic continues to grow. Below, we outline five of the most commonly used wearable devices.  These wristband devices are equipped with sensors to keep track of users' physical activity and heart rate. Many fitness trackers provide health and wellness recommendations by syncing to various smartphone apps. Once only used to count steps and tell time, smartwatches have transformed into clinically viable tools for healthcare. This year, we expect there will be 45.2 million smartwatch users in the US. By 2024, that figure will surpass 50 million.   Wearable ECG monitors are on the cutting edge of consumer electronics. They are able to measure electrocardiograms, or ECGs—helping users track their heart rhythm and rate, as well as measure other vitals, including blood pressure. Omron Healthcare launched HeartGuide in 2019, the first wearable blood pressure monitor. It measures blood pressure and daily activity, including steps taken and calories burned. Over the past few years Omron has developed more wearable blood pressure monitors in an effort to remain a leader in the increasingly competitive space.  Wearable biosensors are still in their infancy stage in regard to large-scale development and adoption, yet they hold potential to revolutionize telemedicine and remote healthcare. These devices are portable sensors that come in the form of gloves, clothing, bandages, and implants. They create two-way feedback between the user and their doctor and enable continuous and noninvasive disease diagnosis and health monitoring from physical motion and biofluids.

Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled on Friday to take the stand as a witness in defense of the company he runs. Apple and the maker of ""Fortnite"" are in a court battle in California — the culmination of a yearlong spat between the two American business giants. Epic Games filed a suit against Apple last summer after its hit game ""Fortnite"" was pulled from Apple's App Store.  Apple says it pulled the game because Epic violated the terms of its developer agreement when Epic implemented a payment system in the game that enabled players to circumvent Apple's App Store. Epic says that the App Store is a monopoly and that iPhones and iPads are no different from computers. The in-person trial began earlier this month at the US District Court for the Northern District of California in Oakland. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has overseen about three weeks of hearings. After three weeks of testimony and questioning by lawyers for both Apple and Epic, Cook is appearing as a witness for the defense as the trial wraps up. It's Cook's first court appearance as a witness on behalf of Apple, though he's appeared at congressional hearings alongside other tech CEOs. While congressional hearings rarely result in action, the results of this trial could have a major influence on Apple's business. There's no way of knowing what the lawyers for Apple and Epic will ask Cook, but at the heart of the fight is a philosophical disagreement on the nature of the iPhone: Epic says it's a computer, while Apple says it's fundamentally distinct. That argument is critical because of how the App Store operates, with Apple acting as the sole arbiter of what can and cannot be published on the iPhone. If the iPhone is a computer, then the App Store is a monopoly, Epic's lawyers say. If it isn't, and it's a distinct category of device, then Apple is protecting its users by keeping alternative digital storefronts off the iPhone, according to the company. Multiple Apple execs have already appeared as witnesses in the trial. Craig Federighi, an Apple senior vice president, most clearly laid out the case that we're likely to hear echoed by Cook: Apple's computers are ""like a car,"" he said, and that means users can take it off road or wherever they'd like — for better or worse — while the iPhone and iPad operating system, iOS, needs to be usable by children and even babies. The Mac operating system, Federighi said, is less secure than iOS because of its open nature. If you were able to download iPhone and iPad apps outside Apple's App Store, Federighi said, you'd be open to a variety of security issues that Apple couldn't review before use. This is because of the App Store's review process, he said, which offers a standard of safety across all iPhone and iPad apps. The trial is expected to wrap up on Monday.

Four US House Representatives have criticized what they call Apple's ""gradual and near-total capitulation"" to China over access to its customer's data, and called on CEO Tim Cook to reassess Apple's business dealings with the country.  Republicans Ken Buck, Scott Fitzgerald, Burgess Owens, and Dan Bishop said that Apple ""continues to concede to the Chinese government's demands,"" in a letter to Cook sent on Thursday, and later shared on Twitter.  A New York Times investigation published Monday said that Cook had approved the use of servers owned by Chinese state-owned companies to store user data, and had agreed to remove encryption technology from Apple's data server centers, according to current and former Apple employees who spoke to the publication.  Apple also agreed to censor about 50,000 apps from its App Store, and company employees were tasked with identifying apps that might offend the Chinese government, according to the paper's sources.  The congressmen said that the company ""has entwined itself with the very rights abuses it claims to oppose.""  ""We urge you to consider Apple's position as a pawn in China's malfeasance,"" the letter said.   When contacted for comment, Apple pointed Insider to a statement it made to the NYT responding to its investigation.  The tech giant said that it has ""never compromised the security of our users or their data in China or anywhere we operate,"" in the statement.  ""We retain control of the encryption keys for our users' data,"" the company said in the statement. ""Since our Chinese data centers are our newest, they feature our very latest and most sophisticated protections."" Apple said that it had removed apps from its App Store to abide by China's laws.  ""These decisions are not always easy, and we may not agree with the laws that shape them,"" it said in the statement."

Al Gore.
Lehtikuva/Vesa Moilanen/Reuters

 Lehtikuva/Vesa Moilanen/Reuters Warren Buffett's right-hand man, Charlie Munger, once called Al Gore an ""idiot"" and ""not very smart."" The former US vice-president's investment firm bought the same two stocks that Buffett and Munger added to their portfolios last quarter. Generation Investment Management, which Gore cofounded and chairs, boosted its stake in Alibaba by 94% to almost 3 million shares in the three months to March 31, regulatory filings show. Daily Journal, a newspaper publisher that boasts Munger as its chairman and stock picker, established a stake in the Chinese e-commerce group last quarter as well. Alibaba was its only new position in the period.


 Generation also invested in Aon in the first quarter. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, which counts Munger as its vice-chairman, bought into the professional-services firm too - the only new addition to its portfolio. It's also worth noting Gore sits on the board of Apple, Berkshire's biggest holding and one of its most lucrative bets ever. Munger disparaged Gore's intelligence at Daily Journal's annual meeting in 2017, according to GuruFocus. He wanted to underscore how surprising it was that Gore had made hundreds of millions of dollars from investing. Gore, who starred in an ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and won a Nobel Peace Prize for raising awareness of the climate crisis, simply refused to invest in carbon-intensive companies, and partnered with a skilled value investor named David Blood. The upshot was that Generation invested in software and service companies such as Microsoft and delivered stellar returns, Munger said. Generation's long-term, sustainable investing approach has resulted in it owning billion-dollar stakes in Google-parent Alphabet, Cisco, Equifax, Charles Schwab, and Baxter International."

Nearly 1,000 Apple employees have signed an internal letter to CEO Tim Cook urging the company to issue a public statement in support of the Palestinian people, The Verge reported Thursday. ""We are frustrated and disappointed because once more, many of those in positions of power and influence — who boldly stand for human rights in so many other just causes — either choose to remain silent or release ineffectually neutral 'both sides' statements with regards to the Palestinian situation,"" wrote the letter's authors, who are members of the Apple Muslim Association, according to The Verge. Apple taking a ""both sides"" approach, they wrote, ""would feel to us as the equivalent of 'all lives matter' — a minimization of the disproportionately larger pain and suffering of the Palestinian people."" Apple did not respond to a request for comment on this story. The letter follows a wave of violence in Gaza, where Israeli military forces have killed at least 232 Palestinians, including 65 children and 39 women, and the militant group Hamas has killed around a dozen Israelis. On Thursday, Israel and Hamas announced a ceasefire. International human rights organizations have condemned Israel's attacks as possible war crimes, and have denounced its treatment of Palestinians as a form of apartheid. More recently, Israel's effort to push Palestinians out of East Jerusalem, and an Israeli police raid on Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, have escalated tensions. The letter to Cook is the second high-profile instance of a large number of Apple employees criticizing the company over ethical concerns in the past week alone — a rare occurrence at Apple. Last week, The Verge reported more than 2,000 employees signed a letter slamming Apple for hiring Antonio García Martínez, citing ""misogynistic"" and racist past comments. Hours later, Apple said García Martínez had left the company (García Martínez claimed Apple fired him)."

AirPlay is a great way to share content between Apple devices, and even to non-Apple devices that are AirPlay-compatible like many smart TVs.  With AirPlay on Mac, you can share music, photos, videos, or just mirror your entire computer screen on a larger display — here's how. 1. Open System Preferences, which you can do by clicking the Apple symbol in the menu bar at the top of your screen and selecting ""System Preferences"" in the drop-down. 2. In System Preferences, find and select the icon for ""Displays,"" which looks like a computer monitor.  3. Check the box next to ""Show mirroring options in the menu bar when available.""  Quick tip: On the Displays page, there's a drop-down menu next to ""AirPlay Display"" which will automatically be turned to ""Off."" This doesn't mean that the AirPlay feature is turned off, it simply means you're not currently AirPlaying your screen. You can mirror the display of your entire Mac screen onto an Apple TV or another AirPlay-compatible device, like an iPad or some smart TVs.  There are two ways to do this. First, make sure your Mac is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as whatever device you'd like to AirPlay to. If you're AirPlaying to an iPad, make sure they're both logged into the same Apple ID account as well. 1. In the menu bar at the top of your Mac's screen, click the AirPlay icon, which looks like a rectangle with an arrow at the bottom.  2. In the drop-down, choose the device you want to AirPlay to.  3. A passcode might appear on your device's screen. Enter it in the pop-up on your Mac.  4. Your Mac should then begin mirroring its screen to the device you selected.  5. To stop AirPlaying, click the AirPlay icon in the menu bar again and choose ""Turn AirPlay off"" in the drop-down. 1. Open System Preferences and click ""Displays."" 2. On the Displays page, click the drop-down next to ""AirPlay Display."" 3. In the drop-down, select the device you want to AirPlay to.  4. A passcode may appear on your device's screen. Enter it in the pop-up on your Mac.  5. Your Mac should then begin mirroring its screen to the device you selected.  6. To stop AirPlaying, click the drop-down next to ""AirPlay Display"" and select ""Off."" Quick tip: You can change how your Mac display is mirrored to another device. Click the AirPlay icon in the menu bar and in the drop-down, select ""Mirror Built-In Retina Display"" to have your other device match what's on your Mac desktop. You can also click ""Use As Separate Display"" to have your Mac screen cast its screen to your other device, rather than both devices displaying the same screen. When attempting to use AirPlay from a Mac to an Apple TV or other AirPlay-compatible device, the most common misstep is not having both devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network.  If you're trying to connect to your iPad, you also need to be logged into the same Apple ID account. If things still aren't matching up, access your computer's Firewall by opening System Preferences, going to ""Security & Privacy"" and selecting ""Firewall."" Make sure the ""Firewall"" is turned off.  It may also be that your devices are not up to date — make sure to update your Mac and the device you're AirPlaying to.  The final troubleshooting method is just to restart all devices — including your internet modem. "

Snapchat's parent company, Snap, on Thursday introduced its next-generation Spectacles product, the company's first pair of glasses that use augmented reality. That means the wearer would be able to overlay anything they wanted to over the real world.  The Spectacles can be used indoors or outdoors and come with two cameras, four microphones, and a touchpad. They're integrated with Lens Studio software that allows creators to build their own designs to use with Spectacles.  Here's how they work:    The new Spectacles have a 30-minute battery life and come equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR1 Platform chip, according to a press release.  A company spokesperson told Insider that the Spectacles aren't for sale and are instead designed for augmented reality creators. The company announced the Spectacles glasses during its Partner Summit event on Thursday. The item features a slightly different design than its predecessors, like the Spectacles 3, which allowed the wearer to record pictures and videos from their point of view. Read more: Snap acquired Ariel AI, a computer vision startup set up by ex-Facebook and Google scientists Snapchat released its $380 Spectacles 3 in late 2019 that come with two cameras that can ""capture the world the way your eyes do,"" Snapchat product strategy manager Lauryn Morris told Insider in 2019. The Spectacles 2.0 debuted in three colors in 2018, allowing wearers to take photos and videos in high-definition. Apple and Facebook also have smart glasses in the works. "

Personal Finance Insider writes about products, strategies, and tips to help you make smart decisions with your money. We may receive a small commission from our partners, like American Express, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. The bottom line: Navy Federal Credit Union is a good institution for people affiliated with the military. Its strongest features are probably its 24/7 live customer support and out-of-network ATM refunds. The Navy Federal Credit Union Share Savings Account is an affordable option, with no minimum opening deposit or monthly service fees. It pays a competitive APY, especially compared to other brick-and-mortar institutions. You can open multiple accounts and name each one to save for separate goals, such as ""Emergency Savings"" or ""Travel Fund."" Navy Federal has several types of 
                          
checking accounts
, and the Free Active Duty Checking Account is a great option if you qualify. You could receive paychecks a day sooner with early direct deposit, and you'll receive up to $20 per month in out-of-network ATM fee refunds. The Navy Federal Credit Union Standard Certificate pays high interest rates. It also has terms as long as seven years, while most institutions only offer term lengths up to five years. Money market accounts are similar to savings accounts, but they make it easier to access your money. The Navy Federal Money Market Account comes with both paper checks and an ATM card, so you can withdraw cash if necessary. This makes it a convenient place to store your emergency fund. Navy Federal Credit Union has 247 branches around the world, including ones on some military bases. (Look here to see a complete list of branches by country or by military branch.) It also has 30,000 free ATMs around the US. If you don't live near a branch, you can still open an account online. Navy Federal has 24/7 live customer support over the phone. Its mobile app has 4.6 out of 5 stars in the Apple store, and 3.7 out of 5 stars in the Google Play store. Your deposits are federally insured by the NCUA for up to $250,000, or up to $500,000 for joint accounts. Navy Federal is a credit union for people associated with the military. You can become a member if you fall under one of the following categories: You'll also need to open a Navy Federal Credit Union Share Savings Account to become a member. The Better Business Bureau gives Navy Federal Credit Union an A- in trustworthiness. Responses to customer complaints play a large part in the BBB's ratings, but it also looks at factors such as honesty in advertising and transparency about business practices. The credit union does have one recent controversy. A Navy Federal employee has claimed the lender pressured mortgage underwriters to approve loans even if they didn't have sufficient reason to believe applicants could repay the loans. Then she filed a lawsuit and said Navy Federal retaliated against her whistleblowing by changing her job duties. She dropped the case in late 2020. We've compared Navy Federal to two other institutions for military-affiliated customers: Pentagon Federal Credit Union and USAA Bank. Savings APY 0.25% APY Savings APY 0.45% APY Savings APY 0.03% APY Standout feature Variety of checking accounts Standout feature High savings APY Standout feature Cash-back checking Navy Federal has several types of checking accounts, so you may find one that's a good fit. Pentagon Federal Credit Union only has one checking account — but it's a high-yield checking account, which you might decide you like. You may prefer Navy Federal if you think you'll use out-of-network ATMs often. Almost all Navy Federal checking accounts refund some ATM fees, whereas PenFed does not reimburse fees. But PenFed could be the better fit if you want to earn a higher interest rate on your savings account. Navy Federal pays a higher interest rate on savings than USAA, and it has more checking account options. But USAA has a cash-back checking account, which is not available with Navy Federal. You'll earn $0.10 cash back every time you use your debit card, and there's no limit on how much you can earn.

While out on a road trip with her 23-year-old daughter in April, Lisa Ross squeezed the steering wheel as she listened to a radio station report on Derek Chauvin being tried for the murder of George Floyd. When prosecutors played an audio clip of Floyd's final words, ""I can't breathe,"" she screamed in agony.  Ross, the US CEO and highest-ranking Black woman at the public-relations giant Edelman, felt Floyd's pain was her own. With the help of her daughter, Ross was able to calm down, but in that moment, she knew Floyd's death — and Chauvin's verdict — would have significant implications on her role as an executive at work. ""I was screaming,"" Ross told Insider, ""because my brothers and father look like George Floyd.""  Floyd's death was a breaking point for millions of people around the globe, a decades-long culmination of unchecked police brutality and racial injustice. Business leaders were then pressured to respond quickly and decisively, reprioritizing their obligations to the employees and communities they serve. It was a massive, public, and nationwide shift toward society as a whole, not just shareholders.  Despite some resistance from Republican politicians and constituents, Floyd's legacy continues to expand the role of CEO to include addressing pervasive social ills by raising wages, investing in underserved communities, and hiring and promoting more people from marginalized backgrounds, multiple experts said. For Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Floyd's murder was a turning point for the financial firm.  ""Watching the events unfold after George Floyd's murder, we understood that we, as a company, could do more to serve and lead,"" Dimon told Insider in an exclusive statement. ""It was a moment when many companies had to decide or recommit to what they stood for.""  Shortly after Floyd's death, JPMorgan pledged more than $30 billion to promote racial justice, the biggest single investment of a US company toward racial equity in the past year. ""Now, more than ever, we are working to make inclusivity and equity a central part of everything we do,"" Dimon said.  Other companies like Citi, Mastercard, and Apple committed large investments. Companies withdrew millions in ads from Facebook to pressure the social-media giant to stop the spread of racist content. Chipotle and Starbucks tied executive compensation to meeting diversity, equity, and inclusion targets. Business leaders hired DEI consultants at record rates.    In the past year, Ross has urged hiring managers at Edelman to be more inclusive in their recruiting. Since May 2020, 48% of senior hires at the firm have been women or people of color. Ross also created a task force to help some 200 new corporate clients craft meaningful pledges to advance racial equity.  ""I was like a dog with a bone,"" Ross, who oversees thousands of employees, said. ""Nothing and no one could stop me.""  Zander Lurie, CEO of SurveyMonkey, said he, too, felt his role quickly evolved after Floyd died.  ""Before George Floyd's death, we cared a lot about DEI, but not on the same pedestal as our product and sales goals,"" Lurie, who's white, told Insider. ""Now we're more fearless about stating that we believe world-class execution in the DEI arena is as important as the products we ship and the revenue targets we set.""  When it comes to racial justice, workers, customers, and investors are holding CEOs to higher standards. They want them to be leaders in not just the business world, but also in society.  ""I almost feel bad for these guys. They're grappling with their role,"" Ross said. ""Things are different.""  About one year before Floyd's death, the role of the CEO had already begun to change. In 2019, JPMorgan's Dimon, along with 180 other business executives, published a public letter that called for a departure from shareholder primacy, the notion championed by economist Milton Friedman in the 1970s that the sole purpose of a company is to drive profits for shareholders. The theory held sway over business for decades, resulting in business leaders chasing profits and cost-cutting measures above all else.  The letter signified that top CEOs were growing distant from Friedman's philosophies. Rising pollution levels and a widening class gap have increased the stakes affecting their businesses.  The 2019 letter essentially told Americans that CEOs were going to double down on these issues. Floyd's death in 2020, along with the pandemic, were the first major tests, according to Just Capital, a nonprofit research firm.  ""It was a turning point,"" Yusuf George, a managing director of corporate engagement at Just Capital who is Black, said. ""It accelerated the move toward stakeholder capitalism.""  The growth in environmental, social, and governance investments and projects over the past year shows a shift in shareholder values. This spring, there were more than 300 ESG proposals for shareholders to vote on. One group of investors representing more than $1.2 trillion in assets made headlines in April asking banks to conduct a third-party audit of their racial-equity plans.  ""Investors are pushing for more transparency,"" George said. ""CEOs need to be bold in the initiatives they're launching.""  The video of Floyd's death shook many business leaders and workers to their core.  ""When I saw the video, I was shocked, disturbed, and disappointed by what I witnessed,"" Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol, who is white, said. ""It was, and still is, a tough video to watch.""   It compelled millions across the world to protest racism and police brutality. And people didn't want statements. They wanted action.  A 2020 survey by The Harris Poll and Just Capital found that more than 60% of the 2,000 participants wanted leaders to promote diversity and inclusion within their companies.  Chipotle's Niccol said he took more time to connect with workers. He said he spent the next year listening to Black and brown employees in a series of conversations and panel events, a good first step, according to DEI experts. He also tied executive compensation to DEI goals.  ""I spent a lot of time listening,"" SurveyMonkey's Lurie said. ""That's one of the most important things leaders can do today.""  Tiffany Jana, a DEI strategist who works with Fortune 500 companies, said demand for their services increased exponentially in the weeks after Floyd's murder. Mandy Price, CEO and cofounder of Kanarys, a DEI technology platform, said her phone was ringing constantly with new inquiries.  ""Before Floyd's tragic death, many CEOs saw DEI as a nice to have, not a need to have,"" but that's no longer the case, Price said. One of the first actions Lurie took last summer was hiring a chief diversity and social impact officer who reports directly to him. He also organized multiple meetings in which Black and brown employees shared their experiences with racism in order to create a more inclusive culture.  The company issued a bonus policy for ERG group leaders, raised more than $300,000 for Black-run nonprofits, and committed to increasing the number of Black-owned businesses it works with. By 2024, the company wants its workforce to include 48% women, 22% from underrepresented minorities, and 4% nonbinary.  Jose Minaya, CEO of Nuveen, TIAA's investment manager, said Floyd's death stirred a mix of emotions for him. ""It made me angry, confused. I was trying to understand, how does this happen?"" Minaya, who is Latino, said. ""After it was playing out, and seeing the reactions of people speaking out, I also felt optimistic. Because some of the right conversations were happening.""  A wave of workers at Refinery29, Glossier, Adidas, and Everlane drove much of that conversation last summer. They spoke out about racism and unfair working conditions.  At Refinery29, for example, one employee tweeted that an executive once confused her with a caterer. Another employee tweeted she was paid $15,000 less than her two white coworkers who were doing the same job. The site's top editor and a cofounder resigned soon after.  ""Increasingly, employees and consumers are expecting corporations to take a stand on social issues,"" Robert Kazanjian, a business professor at Emory University, said. ""In a sense, employees feel the right to hold their management accountable.""  The tech company Basecamp encouraged employees to read books on anti-racism during the protests that followed Floyd's death. But weeks ago, the company banned conversations about ""societal and political"" topics at work. Over one-third of employees resigned as a result. In addition, many people expected CEOs to speak out on Georgia's restrictive voting laws passed in April, as evidenced by protests and social-media posts that populated the internet. ""For CEOs, you can't say something about racial equity and everything else and then not say something about voter suppression and inequity happening in Georgia,"" Ross said. ""Because these are the same issues at play.""   Despite CEOs speaking out more on social and political issues and investing more in diversity initiatives, some worry business leaders are merely engaging in temporary, performative allyship or speaking out for good optics.  ""I fear that many corporations seized the opportunity to engage in Blackwashing: focusing on performative BIPOC inclusion at the expense of substantive change,"" Jana, who is Black and nonbinary, said. Over the long term, companies that merely engage in temporary diversity and inclusion work will be called out by consumers, investors, and employees, they added.  Not all consumers and employees are onboard with CEOs becoming social activists. Some Republican leaders and their constituents have called for boycotts against companies like Coca-Cola, Delta, and Microsoft after leaders criticized voting laws or bills in Georgia, Texas, and Florida.  But polling shows that the majority of Americans support most causes CEOs have been speaking out about recently, like voting access, racial equity, and the climate crisis.   Minaya is optimistic about the future.  ""The stars have aligned. The right conversations are happening,"" he said. ""If you want to attract the best talent and retain them, if you want to attract clients and customers, you have to do a better job of letting the public know what your values as a firm are. You have to stand by them.""  Chauvin was convicted for the murder of Floyd on April 20. George of Just Capital remembers watching the trial, sitting on the couch in his Queens apartment, holding his 7-month-old son.  As the judge read the verdict, George looked down at his son. He thought about his future, feeling thankful but uneasy.  ""We found some level of justice that day, justice for the family but not for society,"" George said. ""We have to advocate for what is just."""

malware
 and viruses. That's according to Apple senior VP Craig Federighi's sworn testimony given on Wednesday in a California court room. ""Today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don't find acceptable,"" he said. For every virus or piece of malware that Apple is able to stop or block, another several pop up. ""It's an endless game of whack-a-mole,"" he said. Federighi appeared as a witness for the defense in an ongoing lawsuit brought against Apple by ""Fortnite"" maker 
                          
Epic Games
. During questioning, Federighi compared the differences in security of Apple's computing platforms. Apple's computers are ""like a car,"" he said, and that means users can take it off-road or wherever they'd like — for better or worse — whereas the iPhone and iPad operating system, iOS, needs to be usable by children and even babies. In the lawsuit, Epic is attempting to force Apple to open its iOS platform to alternate app stores. Epic argues that iOS is a computer operating system and should be open to competition. Apple argues that allowing alternative app stores introduces major security issues.  The Mac operating system, Federighi said, is less secure than iOS specifically because of its open nature. If you were able to download iPhone and iPad apps outside of Apple's App Store, Federighi said, you'd be open to a variety of security issues that Apple couldn't review before use.  This is due to the App Store's review process, he said, which offers a standard of safety across all iPhone and iPad apps.  Read more: Bill Gates and Warren Buffett got 211 billionaires to pledge half their wealth to charity. Now some are falling short — and still getting massive tax breaks. Epic Games filed suit against Apple last summer after its hit game, ""Fortnite,"" was pulled from Apple's App Store. Apple says it pulled the game because Epic violated the terms of its developer agreement when Epic implemented a payment system in the game that enabled players to circumvent Apple's App Store. Epic says the App Store is a monopoly, and argues that iPhones and iPads are no different from computers. The in-person trial began in early May at the US District Court for the Northern District of California in Oakland, California, and is expected to conclude next Monday. Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to take the stand as a witness for Apple on Friday morning.

Before Garry Tan had the Midas touch, he was Jen Wolf's intern. Since then, the tables have turned a bit. For the past five years, Wolf has worked at Initialized Capital, the venture firm started by Tan, as head of operations. This week, she was promoted to president, the company told Insider. Wolf is one of the few women to hold such a position in the male-dominated world of venture capital. Partners who can write checks at venture firms are 86% male, according to All Raise, a nonprofit dedicated to diversity in startup founders and funders. At Initialized, women including Wolf make up half of the six-person senior investment team. Wolf, a former web developer, has hired Tan twice over the years. First, she hired him as an intern at a design firm building early e-commerce websites for brands including Apple, Patagonia, and Nordstrom. She then hired him at a software startup, but he left the role after just a few months because he was accepted into a new program that promised funding for his blogging startup, Posterous. ""This was very early Y Combinator, it was like the second batch. I had never really heard of them,"" Wolf recalled. ""And I was like, 'Hey, you're moving to Boston for six weeks, and they're only giving you $15,000 for 7% of your company. This seems like you might be getting ripped off. Are you OK?' I was like, 'Do you have money problems?"" Initialized is having a good year with Coinbase's IPO already in the bag. Tan wrote one of the first checks for the cryptocurrency exchange, and the firm's seed investment had a return of more than 2,200 times. Other unicorn startups in Initialized's portfolio including Instacart and 
                          
Patreon
 are expected to go public sometime this year. Founded in 2011, the firm is part of a crowded mix of investors chasing startups at the seed stage, where they take the biggest risks in search of the biggest rewards. In the past year, large firms that typically invest in later stages have moved into seed-investing territory, offering term sheets with huge valuations for young companies, in the hopes of squeezing out rival firms. Initialized's strategy for winning deals is to fill its ranks with operators who have more to offer founders than just capital. Each partner has a skillset that is useful for company-building. For example, Wolf has a product and design background, while Kim-Mai Cutler is a former journalist and Alda Leu Dennis worked as a lawyer for nine years. The partners decide as a group whether or not to invest in a company, and any one of them may be called upon to parachute into the startup when the founders have a problem that's relevant to their subject-matter expertise.  ""Jen is the one who makes things happen,"" Cutler told Insider. ""She is very methodical and thoughtful about processes and that pairs well with Garry's more agile approach. We can move fast but everything is very well coordinated."" Wolf sits on the board of database-software startup Narrator, but she spends most of her energy on running the Initialized organization. She's currently hiring a principal and a partner, which she hopes to fill with a candidate from a talent, growth-performance marketing, or technical background. But she said that's not a requirement for the role. ""It's sort of like a startup here,"" Wolf said. ""Garry's still the person who sets the vision and the culture of Initialized."" Her job is to figure out the process of ""how do we make that thing happen."" Are you a venture capital insider with insight to share?

When the headlines broke in 2019, Olivia Jade was already an established influencer with over one million followers on YouTube and Instagram. But as the scandal grew, her influencer career was derailed as brands like Sephora and Amazon dropped her. Sydney Bradley broke down how Olivia Jade is rebuilding her influencer business: Her influencer comeback began in earnest in December 2020, when she spoke publicly about the scandal for the first time on an episode of ""Red Table Talk."" Olivia Jade has shared links to products using affiliate links from the platform RewardStyle. Recently, she has posted sponsored content with the brands Revice Denim and White Fox Boutique (she said she was donating an unspecified amount of money from this partnership). While Olivia Jade's influencer business is rebounding, she has yet to work with brands as prominent as Sephora and Amazon again.

Zhang Yiming, the millennial chief exec of TikTok parent company ByteDance, is to step away from the top job and hand the role over to cofounder and college friend Liang Rubo. The move is an unusual one. Under Zhang's watch, TikTok's popularity has helped drive ByteDance to a reported valuation of $250 billion. Zhang's own personal fortune is pegged by Bloomberg at $44 billion, making him the world's 30th-wealthiest person. And the ByteDance cofounder is relatively young at 38. He is the latest Chinese tech CEO to step down amid increasing pressure from the state for its most successful tech firms to stay in line.  But Zhang writes that he wants to focus on ""longer-term initiatives"" and step away from the ""day-to-day"" nitty gritty. ""I worry that I am still relying too much on the ideas I had before starting the company, and haven't challenged myself by updating those concepts,"" he says. Recently, several colleagues have asked me why I haven't updated my OKRs. Frankly, I feel I did not achieve as much as I had hoped to on my previous objectives in the areas of new strategic opportunities, organizational management, and social responsibility. Since the beginning of this year, I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to better drive real long-term breakthroughs, which cannot simply rely on steady, but incremental, progress. After several months of thinking about this, I came to the conclusion that transitioning out of the role of CEO, with all of the related day-to-day responsibilities, would enable me to have greater impact on longer-term initiatives. Let me explain how I came to this conclusion. Our success over the last nine years has been predicated upon our ability to innovate at just the right moment in the development of the industry. Notably, this has included applying machine learning to mobile and video products. Between graduating from college and starting ByteDance, I spent a lot of time thinking and learning about challenges like effectively disseminating information, using technology to improve products, and approaching the development of a company, much like one would a product: through constant re-evaluation, adjustment, and iteration. That period of profound thinking and ideation helped lay the groundwork for ByteDance. With our business growing well, it is time to think about how we can, not simply scale, but make innovative, meaningful, long-term progress towards our mission to ""Inspire Creativity, Enrich life."" Innovation and success are rooted in years of exploring and imagining what is possible. However, few people have real insight into the future, preferring to model on current and past achievements. People are amazed by the success of electric cars, but they forget that Tesla is 18 years old and first experimented with laptop batteries to power its vehicles. People know about Apple's software management tool HomeBrew, but few realize that computer geeks were discussing the Apple I in the HomeBrew Club in the 1970s. Virtual reality, life science, and scientific computation are playing a bigger role in people's lives as technology brings ever-greater impact to society. This type of progress requires us to break through the inertia, and to keep exploring. At our 7th anniversary, I shared a line from Alice in Wonderland: ""Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."" I like to think about possibilities that are still just that: possibilities. For a long time, I've put my online status as ""Daydreaming."" What I mean isn't that I'm zoning out, but rather that I'm thinking about possibilities that people might think are just fantasy. In the past three years, many things that seemed like fantasies have, in fact, become reality. Yet I worry that I am still relying too much on the ideas I had before starting the company, and haven't challenged myself by updating those concepts. As an example, before 2017, I spent a lot of time keeping track of developments in machine learning. However, since then, while I do my best to bookmark technical articles online, I haven't had the time to make much progress digging into the area. During technology meetings, this sometimes means I actually struggle to keep up with the discussion. Three years ago, I spoke with some entrepreneurs about the challenges of scaling a business. I said that often when companies mature and expand, many fall into the trap of the CEO becoming overly central — listening to presentations, handling approvals, and making decisions reactively. This leads to an over-reliance on existing ideas already in the company, and results in knowledge structures being slow to iterate. In order to avoid this trap, I gradually came to a decision over the last six months to take on a new role at ByteDance. I believe I can best challenge the limits of what the company can achieve over the next decade, and drive innovation, by drawing on my strengths of highly-focused learning, systematic thought, and a willingness to attempt new things. I also believe that giving back to society is an important piece of this, and we have already made some headway, exploring new initiatives in education, brain disease research and digitizing ancient books. Having been involved in some of these myself, I hope to do more by contributing my own ideas and helping deliver new solutions. At the same time, there are still many things that we need to improve, and I think someone else can better drive progress through areas like improved daily management. The truth is, I lack some of the skills that make an ideal manager. I'm more interested in analyzing organizational and market principles, and leveraging these theories to further reduce management work, rather than actually managing people. Similarly, I'm not very social, preferring solitary activities like being online, reading, listening to music, and daydreaming about what may be possible. In March, I began discussing with a small group the possibility of having Rubo, the co-founder of ByteDance, taking over as CEO, and leveraging his strengths in management, organization, and social engagement. The team was understanding and supported the idea. Rubo previously helped me found another company, so we have worked together closely for many years. As many of you know, Rubo has taken on numerous critical roles at ByteDance at different times, including head of R&D, Lark and Efficiency Engineering, and most recently, Human Resources and Management, as we've scaled up at an incredible rate globally. Since Day 1, Rubo has been an invaluable partner — completing my coding for new systems, buying and installing servers, and developing key recruitment and corporate policies and management systems, among a list of contributions too long to enumerate. Over the next six months we will work side by side to ensure the smoothest possible transition, and I know you will all also support him. A few years ago, I posted on social media: ""The meaning of travel lies in switching time and space, which helps you observe others' lives in a new environment as a stranger, and reflect on yourself and your life with a detached eye."" After handing over my role as CEO, and removing myself from the responsibilities of daily management, I will have the space to explore long-term strategies, organizational culture and social responsibility, with a more objective perspective on the company. In our 2012 business plan, I told the team that the most rewarding thing about building a company is being able to enjoy the journey together. I look forward to this new phase and continuing our voyage together! Yiming"

Following years of speculation and anticipation, Ford on Wednesday took the wraps off of its debut all-electric pickup truck: the F-150 Lightning.  The battery-powered version of America's favorite truck offers extra performance and some added functionality over its gas-powered siblings but comes in a familiar package. It'll go on sale in mid-2022 with a starting MSRP of $39,974 and is available to reserve now with a $100 deposit.  That $40,000 gets you a bare-bones work truck, while the cheapest consumer-oriented model — called the XLT — costs $52,974 and up. Pricing can stretch to $90,000 for customers who opt for a larger battery or a fancier Lariat or Platinum trim. More powerful than any F-150 in Ford's current lineup, the F-150 Lightning promises to churn out up to 563 horsepower and 775 lb-ft of torque when equipped with the optional larger battery. Extended-range models can also tow up to 10,000 pounds and hit 60 mph in four seconds and change. All Lightnings come with dual electric motors and four-wheel-drive.  The base model targets an EPA-estimated range of 230 miles, while the extended-range truck should be able to travel 300 miles on a full battery, Ford says. Both those figures will surely be greatly diminished when a heavy trailer or payload is added into the mix, but that shouldn't matter much to folks who buy trucks more for style than necessity.  Still, Ford understands this is something customers are concerned about, so it developed a real-time range calculator that tells drivers how far they can go based on factors like weather conditions, trailer weight, and how much stuff is in the bed. Ford says the F-150 Lightning can recoup from 15% to 80% battery in 41-44 minutes when plugged into a DC fast-charging station.  Read more: Ford's CEO reveals how it beat flashy electric-truck rivals to market with its upcoming $40,000 F-150 EV In the pursuit of making the F-150 Lightning ""distinct, but not different,"" Ford designed the truck to look pretty much the same as its combustion-engine models, inside and out. The most notable exterior differences are the Lightning's closed-off grille and LED light bars in front and rear.   The F-150 Lightning shares a cab with the rest of the 14th-generation F-150 lineup, so it offers the same cool options like a fold-out work surface and seats that recline to 180 degrees. But the F-150 Lightning also has some unique features.  For instance, the truck can power things like TVs, camping equipment, and tools through 11 outlets spread throughout the bed and interior. It also has the optional ability to feed power back into a customer's home in the event of a blackout. A massive frunk — the largest in the industry, Ford says — adds space for items customers can't fit in the back or cab.  Following the larger trend toward bigger and bigger screens in EVs, the Lightning gets a 15.5-inch center touchscreen on higher trims. As expected, the truck comes standard with many of Ford's latest tech features like a 360-degree camera, navigation, and compatibility with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. BlueCruise, the company's advanced driver-assistance suite that allows for hands-free driving on some highways, is optional on Lariat models and comes standard on the Platinum trim. Ford will build the truck at its new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan. It's a key step in the company's transition toward EV production and comes as part of a $29 billion investment in electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025. "

Apple's wireless AirPods are some of the most popular headphones in the world right now. However, they can be expensive — especially if you're looking for the new AirPods Max, which retails at nearly $550. With how popular AirPods are, you might think that Apple would include them with new iPhone purchases. However, while Apple does include some accessories, AirPods aren't part of that package. As the years have passed, Apple has slowly started including less and less accessories with new iPhone purchases. They do this both to cut down on packaging waste, and to encourage consumers to buy accessories separately. If you buy an iPhone from Apple, all you'll receive is the iPhone, a charging cable, and (usually) a SIM card ejector pin. You'll need to buy all of these items separately if you want them. And although any pair of 
                          
Bluetooth
 headphones will work with your iPhone, if you want to use non-Apple wired headphones, you'll likely need to buy a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter, which lets you plug a standard headphone jack into your charging port. Altogether, the cheapest pair of AirPods ($159), a charging adapter ($19), and a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter ($9) will cost around $190, not including tax or shipping. Important: All this information is true if you're buying your iPhone and accessories directly from Apple. If you're buying products from a third-party retailer or reseller, you might receive different prices or accessories. Dave Johnson contributed to a previous version of this article."
40,"Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook on Friday took the witness stand to defend the App Store, a booming part of the iPhone maker’s business that “Fortnite” online game maker Epic Games says is a monopoly that Apple abuses. Cook is expected to spend more than two hours making what are likely to be his most extensive public remarks on the App Store, which anchors Apple’s $53.8 billion services business. Epic has waged a public relations and legal campaign, arguing that Apple acts anticompetitively by only allowing apps it approves on the world’s 1 billion iPhones and by forcing developers to use Apple’s in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up to 30% on sales. The antitrust trial at a federal courthouse in Oakland, California, comes as Apple faces a chorus of criticism from app makers including music service Spotify Technology and U.S. politicians who say the most valuable public U.S. company tries to squash small competition. Cook drank from a steel thermos while waiting in the courtroom gallery before being sworn in at 8:16 a.m. Pacific Time. Apple attorney Veronica Moye of Gibson Dunn began questioning Cook, asking what responsibilities he had over the App Store. Cook said his oversight of the App Store was “more on a review basis.” The maker of “Fortnite,” which pits players against in each other in an animated “Battle Royale” fight to the last survivor, is led by CEO Tim Sweeney, who has reveled in the public opportunity to take on Apple. Sweeney two weeks ago kicked off the trial as Epic’s first witness, using his time on the stand to argue that “Fortnite” has become a place for players to gather in a virtual world he calls the “metaverse” and that Apple is unfairly demanding an outsized cut of profits for providing simple payment processing technology. In the past, Cook fielded a handful of questions about the App Store while testifying before U.S. lawmakers last year, but he has stayed mostly silent as lawmakers grilled the chiefs of Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc. Apple attorneys said they plan to ask him to testify about the company’s corporate values, how the App Store came about and Apple’s competitive landscape. Throughout the trial, Apple has sought to persuade Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers that whatever rules it imposes on developers are aimed at keeping its customers’ information private and safe from malware. But Epic’s legal team has put other Apple executives under pressure during the three-week trial. During a cross-examination Thursday, Apple’s software chief Craig Federighi lashed out at an Epic attorney who did not allow him to explain the technical details of why Apple does not use automated tools to scan for some offensive content. The judge intervened to tell Federighi he would have to explain himself later when Apple’s lawyers resume questioning. Competition authorities in multiple countries have opened probes into the business, including a case in the European Union around Apple’s treatment of Spotify. In United States, lawmakers such as Senator Amy Klobuchar who are contemplating new antitrust laws are likely to comb through the records generated in the Epic case. “This case has always been part of a bigger narrative rather than something that’s going to decide the issue on its own,” said John Bergmayer, legal director at consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.

41,"Snap Inc said Friday it will acquire WaveOptics Ltd, a British augmented reality (AR) technology company, for over $500 million. The deal, first reported by The Verge and confirmed by a Snap spokesman, will help the owner of photo messaging app Snapchat push its way into a future where AR eyewear could be ubiquitous. Snap, along with other tech giants like Facebook Inc and Apple Inc, are racing to build AR devices as the next technological frontier after the smartphone. The vision behind AR eyewear is that it could allow a user to virtually see route directions in front of them, or see information about a landmark in their surroundings, for example. Snap said it will pay half the $500 million for WaveOptics in stock at closing, and the other half will be paid in either cash or stock in two years. Snap is based in Santa Monica, California, while WaveOptics is headquartered in Oxford, England. On Thursday, Snap unveiled a new version of its Spectacles glasses, the first to incorporate AR with two built-in cameras, two speakers and four microphones. The new Spectacles won’t be sold to the public, and will only be available to AR developers who apply to use the glasses.

42,"Snap Inc, owner of photo messaging app Snapchat, announced Thursday it will launch a new standalone app later this year called Story Studio, with video editing tools to help users make professional-level content for mobile. Snap said it will also add a new feature to help notable Snapchat personalities earn money by allowing fans to send paid gifts on the app. The announcements, made during Snap’s annual Partner Summit for app developer and brand partners, are aimed at helping the company compete for more usage in a crowded social media landscape in which platforms like Instagram and TikTok are introducing more ways for users to earn money from creating content. Video creators have earned more than $130 million from posting on its short-form video feature called Spotlight since November, Snap added, which has paid out $1 million per day to Spotlight users. The Santa Monica, California-based company added it will introduce a camera feature called Screenshop, which for example will let users take a photo of an outfit they see, and then receive clothes recommendations from brands to recreate the look. Screenshop is part of Snap’s years-long investment to grow augmented reality technology, which it views as a way to enhance how users interact with their surroundings. Other tech companies including Facebook and Apple are also investing heavily in AR technology.

44,"Apple Inc on Monday began its formal defense in an antitrust trial brought by “Fortnite” online game creator Epic Games, by calling its App Store chief Phil Schiller to the stand. Schiller, who has spent three decades at the iPhone maker, is expected to spend more than 10 hours on the witness stand in federal court in Oakland, California, rebutting Epic’s allegations that Apple has monopoly over mobile developers that it abuses by requiring them to use its in-app payments system and pay commissions. Over the past two weeks, Epic’s executives and expert witnesses argued that Apple has such a strong lock on customers that the world’s more than 1 billion iPhone owners constitute their own separate market over which Apple exercises strict control. Apple and its experts have framed it differently, arguing that Epic’s complaints are related to video game transactions, a market where Apple charges a similar commission to Microsoft Corp’s Xbox and Sony Group Corp’s Playstion. But as the trial enters its final week, Schiller is shifting to the second layer of Apple’s defense: That the controls it imposes on developers are necessary to make the iPhone more private and secure, which has in turn built consumer trust and expanded the market for mobile apps. Legal experts say that is important because even if Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers finds that some of Apple’s rules have anticompetitive effects, she could rule that those effects are outweighed by benefits to consumers overall. On the stand on Monday, Schiller testified that the iPhone originally did not come with any third-party apps because Apple executives felt they had no time to create a secure system for third-party developers to write them. But once the phone went on sale, developers soon started “jailbreaking” devices to put software on them, and Apple rushed to create a formal system, which later became the App Store, for third-party software. “We were very concerned this could create unreliable, unstable devices,” Schiller said of the jailbreaking phenomenon.

45,"Parler, a social media app popular with U.S. conservatives, returned to Apple Inc’s App Store on Monday, after the iPhone maker dropped it following the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Parler also named George Farmer, the company’s chief operating officer since March, as its new chief executive and said interim CEO Mark Meckler would be leaving. Apple said last month it would readmit Parler into its iOS App Store, after Parler proposed updates to its app and content moderation policies. “The entire Parler team has worked hard to address Apple’s concerns without compromising our core mission,” said Meckler in an emailed statement. “Anything allowed on the Parler network but not in the iOS app will remain accessible through our web-based and Android versions. This is a win-win for Parler, its users, and free speech.” The Washington Post said Parler’s Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff likened the iOS version of the app to a “Parler Lite or Parler PG.” Parler is still pushing Apple to allow users to see hate speech behind a warning label, the newspaper reported. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Several tech companies cut ties with Parler after the Capitol riot, accusing the app backed by prominent Republican Party donor Rebekah Mercer of failing to police violent content on its service. Parler went dark for about a month after Amazon.com Inc suspended web-hosting services. Parler returned online in February with Los Angeles-based private cloud infrastructure SkySilk. Amazon Web Services declined to comment on Monday. Alphabet Inc’s Google also removed Parler from its app store. “Parler has remained available on Android because of the openness of the platform even if it isn’t currently distributed through Google Play,” a Google spokesman said on Monday. “As we stated back in January, Parler is welcome back in the Play store once it submits an app that complies with our content moderation policies, which preclude things like physical threats to individuals and inciting violence.” Parler co-founder and CEO John Matze was fired by the board earlier this year. In an emailed statement Parler said new CEO Farmer had been an active financial supporter and candidate for UK’s Brexit Party and “remains actively involved in business and politics on both sides of the Atlantic.” (Reporting by Elizabeth Culliford; Editing by Richard Chang) Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

46,"Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc will let users stream high-quality lossless audio at no extra charge, as they explore new ways to keep subscribers tuned in to their services amid intense competition. Amazon Music, which so far charged a premium for lossless audio, became the first major music service on Monday to upgrade its subscribers to the format. Lossless is a higher quality audio format that preserves every detail of the original audio file without compressing the quality while streaming. American rapper Jay-Z’s Tidal was among the first to roll out the technology, charging $19.99 per month for lossless music. The e-commerce giant’s Amazon Music Unlimited with lossless music will cost less than half that at the industry standard price of $9.99 per month. Separately, Apple said subscribers would be able to listen to its entire music catalog of more than 75 million songs by next month in the lossless format at no additional cost.

51,"A federal judge on Friday grilled Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook over whether the iPhone maker's App Store profits from developers such as ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games are justified and whether Apple faces any real competitive pressure to change its ways. Cook testified for more than two hours in Oakland, California, as the closing witness in Apple's defense against Epic's charges that the iPhone maker's App Store controls and commissionshave created a monopoly that Apple illegally abuses. App makers including music service Spotify Technology (SPOT.N), European regulators and U.S. politicians who question whether the company that once urged the world to 'think different' has now become too big and too powerful. At the end of testimony, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers questioned Cook, pressing him to concede that game developers generate most App Store revenue and help subsidize other apps on the store that pay no commission. Gonzalez said the profits Apple reaps from game developers ""appear to be disproportionate."" ""I understand this notion that somehow Apple is bringing the customer to the dance,"" she said. ""But after that first time, after that first interaction, the developers are keeping customers with the game. Apple is just profiting from that, it seems me."" Cook disagreed. ""The free apps bring a lot to the table. Only the people who are really profiting in a major way are paying 30"" percent commissions, he said. Epic has tried to show that Apple's iPhone is a lucrative platform that locks in users, pointing to an internal Apple document that Epic alleges showed the App Store had 78% operating margins. Cook said the document did not reflect the full costs of running the App Store. The testimony constitutes Cook's most extensive public remarks on the App Store, which anchors Apple's $53.8 billion services business. Apple CEO Tim Cook testifies on the stand during a weeks-long antitrust trial at federal court in Oakland, California, U.S. May 21, 2021. Cook on Friday told a court that threats to iPhone security and privacy required tight control of the App Store, which ""Fortnite"" game maker Epic Games says is a monopoly that Apple illegally abuses.  REUTERS/Vicki Behringer Gonzalez Rogers also cited a survey that found 39% of software developers were unhappy with Apple's app distribution services. ""It doesn't seem to me that you feel pressure or competition to actually change the manner in which you act with developers,"" Gonzalez Rogers said. Cook replied that ""we turn the place upside down"" to respond to developer complaints, but later conceded that he does not receive regular reports on how developers feel about working with Apple. At the start of the three-week trial, Gonzalez Rogers also pressed Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney with tough questions on how forcing Apple to change would ripple through the software world. Sweeney said he had not thought the issue through. The maker of ""Fortnite,"" an online game which pits players against in each other in an animated ""Battle Royale"" fight to the last survivor, has waged a public relations and legal campaign against Apple. Epicparodied Apple's iconic ""1984"" commercial  and argued in court that it acts anticompetitively by only allowing approved apps on the world's 1 billion iPhones and forcing developers to use Apple's in-app payment system which charges sales commissions of up to 30%. See FACTBOX:  read more  Apple has sought to persuade Gonzalez Rogers that its rules for developers are aimed at keeping its customers' information private and safe from malware. ""We have a maniacal focus on the user and doing the right thing by the customer,"" Cook said. ""Safety and security are the foundation that privacy is built on. Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data from people, and we like to provide people with tools to circumvent that."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday said he would not allow his Justice Department to seize the phone or email records of reporters, saying any such move would be ""simply wrong.""

REUTERS/Brittany Hosea-Small Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook takes the witness stand on Friday to defend the lucrative App Store against ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games' allegations that it is a monopoly that Apple illegally abuses. What is Epic and why is it suing? After years of complaints about Apple by app companies like music service Spotify Technology (SPOT.N), Epic sued the most valuable U.S. public company for allegedly using its dominance to rake in bigger profits. Epic has waged a public relations and legal campaign, arguing that Apple acts anticompetitively by only allowing apps it approves on the world's 1 billion iPhones and by forcing developers to use Apple's in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up to 30% on sales. Epic considers this an outsized cut of profits for processing payments. What does Epic want from the trial? Epic's lawsuit seeks injunctions on Apple's actions that would allow third party app stores on the iPhone and wants app developers to be able to use their own in-app payment systems, circumventing Apple's commission. What has been Apple's defense? What will Cook say? Cook, who took over from founder Steve Jobs in 2011, is expected to spend more than two hours talking about Apple's corporate values, how the App Store came about, and Apple's competitive landscape. It is likely to be his most extensive public remarks to date on App Store, which anchors Apple's $53.8 billion services business. Cook is expected to press the case that App Store's rules are aimed at shielding customers from malware and protecting their privacy. Who will decide the case? The case is being heard by federal Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who was nominated to the bench by then-President Barack Obama in 2011. She is at the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California. The trial is in Oakland, California. What other probes does Apple face? In late April, European Union regulators accused Apple of distorting competition in the music streaming market, siding with Spotify in a case that could lead to a hefty fine and changes in the iPhone maker's lucrative business practices. The findings are preliminary and the first time Brussels has leveled anti-competitive charges against Apple.  read more  The U.S. Justice Department has also been investigating Apple's app store, at least since June 2019. In that probe, some app developers have accused Apple of introducing new products very similar to existing apps created by other developers and sold in the Apple Store, and then trying to banish the older apps from the store.  read more  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

The move comes at a time when the video gaming industry has benefited from a surge in demand from gamers staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Netflix has experimented with interactive programming in the past with movies such as ""Black Mirror: Bandersnatch"" and ""You vs. Wild"" that enabled viewers to decide the characters' moves. It has also created games based on shows ""Stranger Things"" and ""La casa de Papel (Money Heist)"". The Information reported earlier on Friday Netflix had discussed offering a bundle of games similar to Apple's online subscription offering, Apple Arcade, as an option.

The case is being heard by federal Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who was nominated to the bench by then-President Barack Obama in 2011. She is at the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California. The trial is in Oakland, California. What other probes does Apple face? In late April, European Union regulators accused Apple of distorting competition in the music streaming market, siding with Spotify in a case that could lead to a hefty fine and changes in the iPhone maker's lucrative business practices. The findings are preliminary and the first time Brussels has leveled anti-competitive charges against Apple.  read more  The U.S. Justice Department has also been investigating Apple's app store, at least since June 2019. In that probe, some app developers have accused Apple of introducing new products very similar to existing apps created by other developers and sold in the Apple Store, and then trying to banish the older apps from the store.  read more  Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

60,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Terry Slavin – Editor, Reuters Professional 8 Min Read Joe Biden’s ambitious pledge last month to halve U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and the EU’s move to raise its 2030 target for cutting emissions from 40% to 55%, appear to be two leaps forward for humankind by pushing for urgent action to turn the tide on disastrous climate change. The question, however, is whether the politicians who attended Biden’s climate summit will be able to commandeer the companies that produce the vast majority of climate destroying emissions into action to deliver their targets. Policymakers are critical in that they have the power to turn progressive voluntary action by a small group of companies to cut their carbon footprint into mandatory requirements governing entire sectors, rewarding early adopters, levelling the playing field, and scaling up impact. It’s why Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, BMW and Volvo supported California in its battle with the Trump administration, which sought to reverse rules set by the state a decade ago requiring automakers to reduce CO2 emissions by around 30% between now and 2025. Others, including GM, Nissan, Toyota and Subaru in the Coalition for Sustainable Automotive Regulation – a case of double-speak if ever there was one - backed Trump’s lawsuit, though GM and Nissan pulled out just after Biden’s election, and the rest left in February. The same dynamic is playing out at the moment in the EU, where Europe’s automakers are due to find out in July what their contribution to the EU’s new climate target will be. Reuters reports that Volkswagen, which owns Porsche, Audi, VW, Seat, and Skoda, is telegraphing to policymakers that it would support even more ambitious cuts in emissions, upsetting smaller rivals who want Brussels to give them more leeway. But just how prepared are even the most ambitious companies to follow where policymakers have said they will lead? In partnership with Signal Climate Analytics, Reuters has been exploring the extent to which the top 250 publicly traded emitters, which together account for more than a third of global CO2 emissions, are bringing their operations in line with the global agenda of keeping global temperature rises to well below 2C. Looking at the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the transportation sector, which accounts for about a fifth of global CO2, in the accompanying chart we see the following pledges, with the final dark green bar awarded to firms that have made a commitment similar to the new country-wide U.S. goal, with a target over the next decade committing to over 40% decarbonisation. Among the 27 names on the list, only five of them, AP Moeller-Maersk, Daimler, Delta Airlines, General Motors and Volkswagen, have made a sufficient commitment in line with a sub 2C world, according to Signal Climate Analytics. Another 11 have set targets in line with science, but have not set targets for action in their dominant emissions type, those from their product use and supply chains, known as their scope 3 emissions, in the next nine years. Looking more broadly at the 250 largest emitters, only 10% have committed to meaningful decarbonisation in the next decade. There has been a lack of guidance for how companies can set credible net-zero goals, and, equally importantly, a mechanism to hold their feet to the fire and ensure they follow through. The Science Based Targets Initiative, which was set up in 2015 ahead of the Paris Climate summit, has until now only set rules for decarbonisation of companies’ direct operations in line with a 2C world. Net-zero carbon target-setting by both countries and companies is a more recent phenomenon, in the wake of the 2018 IPCCC report that stressed the need for emissions to fall to zero by 2050 to keep global warning to 1.5C. SBTi is in the process of developing a global standard for net-zero businesses, which will have to align with a below 2C world, but it will not be published until later this year. The new standard will have requirements for monitoring, verification and annual reporting of progress towards targets, something that has until now been missing. Tim Nixon, CEO of Signal Climate Analytics, says there should be far more data disclosure from companies about their environmental impacts, including their capacity: • To deliver progressively larger emissions reductions over time through specific product and operational innovation • Of renewable energy sources to fill the energy gap in their value chain • To eliminate human rights abuses, particularly in sectors like metals, mining and consumer goods • Implement circularity of their products and processes Regulators are already moving to force their hands in this direction. Internationally, the London-based International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS) has been asked by governments and financial regulators to establish a consistent, single set of global standards on how listed companies should disclose risks from climate-change in their operations. This will replace the current patchwork of public and private-sector approaches that make it harder for investors to compare companies, and has allowed for the proliferation of greenwash. In April officials leading the project said it aims to publish its first batch of standards by the middle of next year. In Europe a new proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting directive was published in April that will require companies to publish information on how their strategy aligns with limiting global warming to 1.5C, and to the EU’s own climate transition benchmarks. And such action now looks likely to be replicated in the U.S, where there are currently no mandatory standards for disclosing climate risks, following the Biden Administration’s new Executive Order on Climate-Related Risk. According to Mindy Lubber, CEO of ESG nonprofit Ceres, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Sean Casten are expected to re-introduce Senate and House bills soon that would require companies to disclose climate risk, while for the first time, publicly traded companies including Apple, HP, Salesforce, and Uber have announced public support for regulatory action by the SEC to mandate climate disclosure rules. But Nixon says he doesn’t think companies should be let off the hook from taking action now. “There will not be agreement in our lifetime on the perfect standard, and competing regional claims for a new ‘global’ standard will likely extend the debate,” he says. “Companies know where their emissions are concentrated, and they can choose to report and reduce, starting today, and progress meaningfully and transparently over the next decade.” He adds: “We desperately need a new Protocol like that agreed in Montreal for ozone which was completed in less than 18 months once the severity of the problem was agreed,” Nixon said. “Such a treaty would build on current regional proposals and bind all nations together on a unified corporate framework for reporting and targets. ” In absence of such an instrument, he said, we are left looking largely to the heads of global businesses for change in the very near term.

62,"A federal judge on Friday grilled Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook over whether the iPhone maker's App Store profits from developers such as ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games are justified and whether Apple faces any real competitive pressure to change its ways. Cook testified for more than two hours in Oakland, California, as the closing witness in Apple's defense against Epic's charges that the iPhone maker's App Store controls and commissionshave created a monopoly that Apple illegally abuses. App makers including music service Spotify Technology (SPOT.N), European regulators and U.S. politicians who question whether the company that once urged the world to 'think different' has now become too big and too powerful. At the end of testimony, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers questioned Cook, pressing him to concede that game developers generate most App Store revenue and help subsidize other apps on the store that pay no commission. Gonzalez said the profits Apple reaps from game developers ""appear to be disproportionate."" ""I understand this notion that somehow Apple is bringing the customer to the dance,"" she said. ""But after that first time, after that first interaction, the developers are keeping customers with the game. Apple is just profiting from that, it seems me."" Cook disagreed. ""The free apps bring a lot to the table. Only the people who are really profiting in a major way are paying 30"" percent commissions, he said. Epic has tried to show that Apple's iPhone is a lucrative platform that locks in users, pointing to an internal Apple document that Epic alleges showed the App Store had 78% operating margins. Cook said the document did not reflect the full costs of running the App Store. The testimony constitutes Cook's most extensive public remarks on the App Store, which anchors Apple's $53.8 billion services business. Apple CEO Tim Cook testifies on the stand during a weeks-long antitrust trial at federal court in Oakland, California, U.S. May 21, 2021. Cook on Friday told a court that threats to iPhone security and privacy required tight control of the App Store, which ""Fortnite"" game maker Epic Games says is a monopoly that Apple illegally abuses.  REUTERS/Vicki Behringer Gonzalez Rogers also cited a survey that found 39% of software developers were unhappy with Apple's app distribution services. ""It doesn't seem to me that you feel pressure or competition to actually change the manner in which you act with developers,"" Gonzalez Rogers said. Cook replied that ""we turn the place upside down"" to respond to developer complaints, but later conceded that he does not receive regular reports on how developers feel about working with Apple. At the start of the three-week trial, Gonzalez Rogers also pressed Epic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney with tough questions on how forcing Apple to change would ripple through the software world. Sweeney said he had not thought the issue through. The maker of ""Fortnite,"" an online game which pits players against in each other in an animated ""Battle Royale"" fight to the last survivor, has waged a public relations and legal campaign against Apple. Epicparodied Apple's iconic ""1984"" commercial  and argued in court that it acts anticompetitively by only allowing approved apps on the world's 1 billion iPhones and forcing developers to use Apple's in-app payment system which charges sales commissions of up to 30%. See FACTBOX:  read more  Apple has sought to persuade Gonzalez Rogers that its rules for developers are aimed at keeping its customers' information private and safe from malware. ""We have a maniacal focus on the user and doing the right thing by the customer,"" Cook said. ""Safety and security are the foundation that privacy is built on. Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data from people, and we like to provide people with tools to circumvent that."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

63,"Britain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex looks on as he attends the funeral of Britain's Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth, who died at the age of 99, in Windsor, Britain, April 17, 2021. Chris Jackson/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Prince Harry said he abused alcohol to numb the pain of his mother Diana’s death in 1997, and accused the British royal family of neglecting him and his wife Meghan as she contemplated suicide. Harry, now 36, has spoken before about the trauma of losing Diana in a Paris car crash and then having to walk as a 12-year-old behind his mother's coffin in her funeral cortege under the glare of the world's media. ""I was willing to drink, I was willing to take drugs, I was willing to try and do the things that made me feel less like I was feeling,"" Harry told Oprah Winfrey in an Apple TV series about mental health. ""I would probably drink a week’s worth in one day on a Friday or a Saturday night and I would find myself drinking not because I was enjoying it but because I was trying to mask something,"" he said. Harry said the loss of his mother accentuated fears about his own wife Meghan when she grappled with suicidal thoughts, although he said the British royal family neglected them both. ""The thing that stopped her from seeing it through was how unfair it would be on me after everything that had happened to my mum and to now be put in a position of losing another woman in my life, with a baby inside of her, our baby,"" he said. ""I felt completely helpless. I thought my family would help, but every single ask, request, warning, whatever it is, just got met with total silence or total neglect."" Harry's repeated public criticism of the British royal family, led by his 95-year-old grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, and his 72-year-old father, Prince Charles, has created another public relations crisis for the monarchy. The queen has said she was saddened to learn of the experiences of Harry and Meghan. She said that while recollections might differ, the royal family would also address issues around race that had been raised by the couple, who said one unnamed royal made a racist comment about their son Archie before he was born.

64,"As U.S. stocks are hit with a bout of volatility, some investors are looking to European equities, attracted by lower valuations and the region’s nascent emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. European equity funds have notched their longest streak of net inflows in more than three years, according to data from EPFR, while fund managers globally surveyed by BofA Global Research said they are more overweight European stocks than at any time since March 2018. Morgan Stanley’s strategists, meanwhile, have named holding European stocks as one of their top trades. The focus on Europe comes as the region’s benchmarks have kept pace with their U.S. counterparts after years of underperformance. The STOXX 600 (.STOXX) is up 10.7% year-to-date, broadly matching the S&P 500. The S&P 500 was off 1.7% from its record high as of Thursday, while the European index has slipped 0.8% from its peak. ""We have been more exposed to the U.S. over the past years and now we are becoming more interested in foreign equities,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. Investors see an opportunity as Europe's recovery begins to take root while the U.S. economic growth rate is expected to soon peak. European indexes are also more heavily weighted in the types of stocks expected to perform particularly well as the global economy bounces back, such as financials and industrials. “Vaccinations are ticking up, you are likely to see restrictions come off and that should mean a decent economic recovery which will bleed into the markets in the euro zone,” Schutte said. After contracting in the first quarter, the euro zone's gross domestic product is expected to increase in the second quarter and post its fastest growth in the third, rising on an annualized basis by 9.2%, according to Oxford Economics. U.S. GDP, meanwhile, is expected to post its peak growth rate of 13.3% in the second quarter, after it expanded in the first quarter.  read more  Meanwhile, nearly 48% of the U.S. population had received at least one vaccine dose as of Wednesday, compared with almost 28% of the European population, according to Our World in Data. “The story for the first few months of this year has been around U.S. exceptionalism,"" said Mona Mahajan, senior U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors. ""As we look through to the next three to six months, that may fade a bit especially if Europe continues to play catch-up.” Many European stocks are also trading at relative discounts to their U.S. counterparts. The S&P 500 trades at nearly 21 times forward earnings compared with 16.7 times for the STOXX index, according to Refinitiv Datastream - a wider gap than on average over the past 10 years, although that difference has recently narrowed. Part of the gap stems from the fact that U.S. indexes are more heavily skewed towards tech and other growth stocks that tend to carry higher valuations. Those stocks have helped propel the U.S. stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago and helped push S&P 500 performance ahead of European markets, but could fall out of favor as rising bond yields and inflation fears cut into their valuations. Several factors could complicate the decision to shift into European stocks. With tech and internet giants such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) continuing to put up strong profits, investors may be reluctant to cut back on a trade that has worked for years.  read more  As inflation worries have hit U.S. stocks in recent weeks, there are also some concerns about euro zone inflation, which is approaching 2%, its fastest rate in years.  read more  Any setbacks to Europe's COVID-19 response and economic rebound also could undermine the case for equities there, investors said. So could a reversal in the dollar’s recent weakening trend, which would hurt U.S. investors seeking to convert profits in their euro-denominated assets back into their home currency. The dollar is down about 4% against the euro  since the start of April. ""The next move we make is probably going to be to decrease the U.S. and increase international just because of the forces that we are seeing in the market,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer of People’s United Wealth Management in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

65,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Mike Dolan 6 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s wild ride this week is far from unusual for the largest crypto token - but the rollercoaster is also its inherent contradiction. Speculators betting for years on bitcoin becoming a stateless digital currency that’s widely used for online retail and payments are largely responsible for its parabolic price rises. But they also seed the sort of blinding volatility that makes that ambition almost untenable. Bitcoin’s 30% plunge on Tuesday after another Chinese government crackdown is not unique. Daily moves of more than 20% have been frequent during the past 6 years. At almost 4.5%, median daily price swings over that time period are more than 6 times that of the main Transatlantic euro/dollar exchange rate. And while some online retailers might accept bitcoin as payment for goods priced in dollars, few could manage the potential accounting chaos of sticker pricing in bitcoin if its value can routinely shift by a fifth in just hours. The flipside is true for buyers. If you think bitcoin’s price keeps on rising over time - much like the latest quadrupling over the past 12 months - then why would you surrender those gains by paying for anything with bitcoin today? And so if that role as a transaction currency or stable store of value remains elusive, it’s essentially just a game of hoarding a finite number of tokens by small groups of people that routinely involves wild, illiquid swings whenever regulators pounce, backers tweet support or big players cash in. As ever, arguments about pros and cons of crypto tokens divide among believers and non-believers - blind faith versus instant dismissal, cheer-leading versus scorn. Deutsche Bank this week likened bitcoin belief structures to the so-called “Tinkerbell effect” - a theory drawing from childrens’ book character Peter Pan’s claim that the fairy only exists because the kids believe she does. “In other words, the value of Bitcoin is entirely based on wishful thinking,” wrote Deutsche analyst Marion Laboure. Laboure estimates that less than 30% of transactions in bitcoin are currently related to payments - the rest is trading, speculation, investment or related activities. And she reckons its liquidity as an investment asset is low. With about 28 million bitcoins changing hands last year, that’s 150% of all those in circulation - almost half the equivalent metric for Apple shares. With a market capitalisation still about $1 trillion, governments can’t ignore bitcoin, even if central banks continue to dismiss its wider systemic importance. They may even welcome the fact its emergence over the past decade has spurred so-called “fintech” innovation as they gradually develop their own central bank digital currencies over the coming years. But Deutsche’s Laboure reckons more crackdowns will come - and most likely the whenever bitcoin even looks like rivalling their currencies for payment. “It is no surprise that governments are not inclined to give up their monetary monopolies. Throughout history, governments first regulate and then take ownership.” If so, what’s the endgame of all the speculation and hoarding - which just further limits bitcoin supply and drives the price higher? Is it just “pass the parcel” while the music keeps playing? Or are people with money to burn punting for quick gains and trading strategically by timing entry and exits? Some argue there is genuine demand for crypto transfers within the half trillion dollars per year of global remittances, as migrant workers often need to funnel money back to poorer countries with strict formal exchange controls. Others claim crypto privacy features draw in demand from criminals, as per this month’s ransomeware hack at Colonial pipeline. But that will just hasten more regulation. Investment arguments beyond simply punting it ever higher range from a lack of “correlation” with other assets to a potential role as an inflation hedge - an odd assertion given its latest reversal comes amid all the post-pandemic inflation scares. Powerful backers have a outsize say too, but are increasingly erratic. Tesla billionaire Elon Musk drove the price skywards earlier this year by saying Tesla would accept bitcoins as payment for its dollar-priced electric vehicle and add bitcoin to the company balance sheet - only to backtrack last week by warning about excessive energy usage in bitcoin mining. With no obvious rationale, star tech stock investor Cathie Wood of Ark Invest claimed this week that bitcoin would rise another tenfold again after it registered a 50% loss in a month. At the $500,000 level she posits, the market cap of bitcoin would then be $10 trillion - or a third of the entire M1 money supply of G20 economies. London School of Economics’ Jon Danielsson reckons that as a result of the concentration of bitcoin ownership, that sort of move would create new multi billionaires - or even the first trillionaire. And that would wildly exaggerate existing wealth skews as the gap between bitcoin haves and have-nots soars to intolerable levels, making a mockery of claims of crypto “democratisation”. As a result, he thinks co-existence of bitcoin and so-called fiat currencies is impossible. It’s all or nothing. If it replaces all G20 currencies in circulation, that would then see each bitcoin priced at $1.5 million. Reality or fiction? “Bitcoin is a bubble,” Danielsson concludes. “It makes sense to ride the bubble as long as possible – just get out in time.” The author is editor-at-large for finance and markets at Reuters News.

66,"As U.S. stocks are hit with a bout of volatility, some investors are looking to European equities, attracted by lower valuations and the region’s nascent emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. European equity funds have notched their longest streak of net inflows in more than three years, according to data from EPFR, while fund managers globally surveyed by BofA Global Research said they are more overweight European stocks than at any time since March 2018. Morgan Stanley’s strategists, meanwhile, have named holding European stocks as one of their top trades. The focus on Europe comes as the region’s benchmarks have kept pace with their U.S. counterparts after years of underperformance. The STOXX 600 (.STOXX) is up 10.7% year-to-date, broadly matching the S&P 500. The S&P 500 was off 1.7% from its record high as of Thursday, while the European index has slipped 0.8% from its peak. ""We have been more exposed to the U.S. over the past years and now we are becoming more interested in foreign equities,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. Investors see an opportunity as Europe's recovery begins to take root while the U.S. economic growth rate is expected to soon peak. European indexes are also more heavily weighted in the types of stocks expected to perform particularly well as the global economy bounces back, such as financials and industrials. “Vaccinations are ticking up, you are likely to see restrictions come off and that should mean a decent economic recovery which will bleed into the markets in the euro zone,” Schutte said. After contracting in the first quarter, the euro zone's gross domestic product is expected to increase in the second quarter and post its fastest growth in the third, rising on an annualized basis by 9.2%, according to Oxford Economics. U.S. GDP, meanwhile, is expected to post its peak growth rate of 13.3% in the second quarter, after it expanded in the first quarter.  read more  Meanwhile, nearly 48% of the U.S. population had received at least one vaccine dose as of Wednesday, compared with almost 28% of the European population, according to Our World in Data. “The story for the first few months of this year has been around U.S. exceptionalism,"" said Mona Mahajan, senior U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors. ""As we look through to the next three to six months, that may fade a bit especially if Europe continues to play catch-up.” Many European stocks are also trading at relative discounts to their U.S. counterparts. The S&P 500 trades at nearly 21 times forward earnings compared with 16.7 times for the STOXX index, according to Refinitiv Datastream - a wider gap than on average over the past 10 years, although that difference has recently narrowed. Part of the gap stems from the fact that U.S. indexes are more heavily skewed towards tech and other growth stocks that tend to carry higher valuations. Those stocks have helped propel the U.S. stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago and helped push S&P 500 performance ahead of European markets, but could fall out of favor as rising bond yields and inflation fears cut into their valuations. Several factors could complicate the decision to shift into European stocks. With tech and internet giants such as Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) continuing to put up strong profits, investors may be reluctant to cut back on a trade that has worked for years.  read more  As inflation worries have hit U.S. stocks in recent weeks, there are also some concerns about euro zone inflation, which is approaching 2%, its fastest rate in years.  read more  Any setbacks to Europe's COVID-19 response and economic rebound also could undermine the case for equities there, investors said. So could a reversal in the dollar’s recent weakening trend, which would hurt U.S. investors seeking to convert profits in their euro-denominated assets back into their home currency. The dollar is down about 4% against the euro  since the start of April. ""The next move we make is probably going to be to decrease the U.S. and increase international just because of the forces that we are seeing in the market,"" said John Traynor, chief investment officer of People’s United Wealth Management in Bridgeport, Connecticut. But, Traynor added, ""when the dollar is moving up, that hurts you if you’re investing internationally."" Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

67,"Britain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex looks on as he attends the funeral of Britain's Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth, who died at the age of 99, in Windsor, Britain, April 17, 2021. Chris Jackson/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Prince Harry said he abused alcohol to numb the pain of his mother Diana’s death in 1997, and accused the British royal family of neglecting him and his wife Meghan as she contemplated suicide. Harry, now 36, has spoken before about the trauma of losing Diana in a Paris car crash and then having to walk as a 12-year-old behind his mother's coffin in her funeral cortege under the glare of the world's media. ""I was willing to drink, I was willing to take drugs, I was willing to try and do the things that made me feel less like I was feeling,"" Harry told Oprah Winfrey in an Apple TV series about mental health. ""I would probably drink a week’s worth in one day on a Friday or a Saturday night and I would find myself drinking not because I was enjoying it but because I was trying to mask something,"" he said. Harry said the loss of his mother accentuated fears about his own wife Meghan when she grappled with suicidal thoughts, although he said the British royal family neglected them both. ""The thing that stopped her from seeing it through was how unfair it would be on me after everything that had happened to my mum and to now be put in a position of losing another woman in my life, with a baby inside of her, our baby,"" he said. ""I felt completely helpless. I thought my family would help, but every single ask, request, warning, whatever it is, just got met with total silence or total neglect."" Harry's repeated public criticism of the British royal family, led by his 95-year-old grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, and his 72-year-old father, Prince Charles, has created another public relations crisis for the monarchy. The queen has said she was saddened to learn of the experiences of Harry and Meghan. She said that while recollections might differ, the royal family would also address issues around race that had been raised by the couple, who said one unnamed royal made a racist comment about their son Archie before he was born.

68," Sections TV Featured More from NBC  Follow NBC News  Snap is acquiring WaveOptics, a company that creates lenses and other parts that are used in augmented reality glasses. The acquisition will give Snap many of the components to create glasses that people can wear and then see computer-generated imagery overlaid on top of the real world. Snap confirmed to CNBC Friday the deal is worth about $500 million in cash and stock, with about half paid upfront in stock. Snap will pay the remainder in cash or stock in two years. The Verge first reported on the acquisition. Snap unveiled its first augmented reality Spectacles glasses on Thursday, but they aren’t for sale. Instead, Snapchat is giving them to creators first, as it presumably continues to fine-tune the glasses until it’s ready to sell a version to consumers. The new Spectacles use lenses developed by WaveOptics. They’re a first step in the race to AR glasses among tech companies, however, with other firms like Apple and Facebook working on similar products. Developers will need to make compelling apps for the glasses, which currently only have about 30 minutes of battery life. Snap is well on its way to having lots of compelling augmented reality apps, however, since AR is already a big part of the Snapchat app. Snapchat users can already take advantage of AR for shopping, creating video and photo filters and more through their phones. Snap’s AR glasses are different than some AR productss that already exist, like Microsoft’s HoloLens 2, which is much larger and looks more like a headset than a set of glasses. WaveOptics creates some of the parts that people look through while wearing the glasses, like waveguides, which are sort of like little windows you look through that show the computer-generated imagery, and projectors that direct light at the waveguides. It also makes and sells full solutions, called modules, which include the waveguides and projectors mounted to frames. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"
69," Sections TV Featured More from NBC  Follow NBC News  SAN RAMON, Calif. — Apple CEO Tim Cook will take the witness stand Friday to defend the company’s iPhone app store against charges that it has grown into an illegal monopoly — one far more profitable than his predecessor Steve Jobs envisioned when it opened up 13 years ago. The technology company is counting on Cook’s appearance to put the finishing touches on Apple’s defense against an antitrust case brought by Epic Games, maker of the popular video game Fortnite. Epic is trying to topple the so-called “walled garden” for iPhone and iPad apps that welcomes users and developers while keeping competition out. Created by Jobs a year after the iPhone’s 2007 debut, the App Store has become a key revenue source for Apple, a money-making machine that helped power the company to a $57 billion profit in its last fiscal year. Epic is trying to prove that the store has morphed into a price-gouging vehicle that not only reaps a 15% to 30% commission from in-app transactions, but blocks apps from offering other payment alternatives. That extends to just showing a link that would open a web page offering commission-free ways to pay for subscriptions, in-game items and the like. Apple fiercely defends the commissions as a fair way for app makers to help pay for innovations and security controls that have benefited both iPhone users and app developers, including Epic. Apple says it has invested more than $100 billion in such features. It also argues that App Store commissions mirror fees charged by major video game consoles — Sony’s PlayStation, Microsoft’s Xbox and Nintendo’s Switch — as well as a similar app store run by Google for more than 3 billion mobile Android devices. That is roughly twice the number of active iPhones, iPads and iPods that rely on Apple’s store for apps. Apple’s ironclad control over the App Store is already under investigation by regulators and lawmakers in Europe and the U.S. Epic lawyers are expected to spend several hours grilling Cook on the stand. The questioning is likely to dissect the strategies Cook has drawn up since taking the CEO job nearly a decade ago, just a few months before Jobs died of cancer in October 2011. The App Store ranks among Apple’s biggest successes during Cook’s reign. Since beginning with just 500 apps in 2008 the store has ballooned to 1.8 million apps, most of which are free. Apple has drawn upon its commissions and exclusive in-app payment system to help more than double the annual revenue of its services division from $24 billion in fiscal 2016 to $54 billion last year. This boom wasn’t something Jobs foresaw. Shortly after the store opened, Jobs publicly said Apple didn’t expect the App Store to be very lucrative. Epic’s lawyers have repeatedly cited those comments as evidence that Apple reshaped the store to fuel its earnings growth once the popularity of mobile apps became clear. Exactly how profitable the App Store is has been a point of contention throughout the three-week trial. An accounting expert hired by Epic estimated that its profit margins range from 70% to 80%, based on a review of confidential Apple documents. But Apple has insisted those numbers aren’t accurate because they don’t reflect expenses spread throughout the company’s operations. Phil Schiller, a longtime Apple executive and former Jobs confidant, conceded earlier this week that the company’s commission system had generated more than $20 billion in revenue through June 2017. Epic lawyer Katherine Forrest had presented him with that estimate, based on numbers that Apple publicly released in mid-2017. Epic’s questioning of Schiller may foreshadow how Epic’s lawyers intend to go after Cook, who is generally unflappable in public and tightly focused on his message when dealing with reporters and lawmakers. Epic’s lawyers have repeatedly referred to internal exchanges involving Jobs and other executives to depict Apple as using its investment in security and personal privacy as an excuse for preserving the huge profits that flow from its app store. During Schiller’s testimony, for instance, Epic’s lawyers submitted a 2008 email Jobs sent to Schiller and another executive. In that note, Jobs wondered whether Google was taking aim at the then-nascent ad market that was emerging on the iPhone, which relies on operating software called iOS. “The more energy they devote to iOS the better,” Jobs wrote to Schiller. Forrest then challenged Schiller with two questions. “You wanted Google to be beholden to Apple?” she asked, soon following with, “You were basking in the power to destroy a company’s business?” Schiller answered no to both questions. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"
70," Sections TV Featured More from NBC  Follow NBC News  Oprah and Prince Harry’s new series for Apple TV+, “The Me You Can’t See,” features several stories from both everyday people and celebrities on how they struggle with their mental health. In one especially poignant scene from the first episode, pop star Lady Gaga opens up about being sexually assaulted at the age of 19. She said a music producer she was working with told her to “take your clothes off.” “And I left and they told me they were going to burn all my music,"" she recalled. ""And they didn’t stop, they didn’t stop asking me and I just froze and I just… I…I don’t even remember,” she said, crying. She said she would not publicly name her abuser. “I understand this Me Too movement, I understand that some people feel really comfortable with this, and I do not,” she said. “I do not ever want to face that person again. This system is so abusive and so dangerous."" Gaga added that years after she was assaulted, she went to the hospital for her chronic pain and was surprised when a psychiatrist was brought in. “I said why is there a psych here, I can’t feel my body,” she chuckled. “First I felt full on pain, then I went numb and then I was sick for weeks and weeks and weeks after.” “And I realized that it was the same pain that I felt when the person who raped me dropped me off pregnant on the corner at my parents’ house because I was vomiting and sick,” she said. “Because I’d been being abused, I was locked away in a studio for months.” “I’ve had so many MRIs and scans, right, they can’t, they don’t find nothing. But your body remembers,” she said. Gaga went on to say that the trauma of her experience led to “a total psychotic break” for a few years. In that time, she won an Oscar for her performance in the 2019 film “A Star is Born.” “You can come back from things like that but when it hits you really hard it can change you,” she said. “I went through a really crazy time in my head that I still work on and I’m trying to make sure that I give back with that experience instead of just, I don’t know, locking it away and faking it.” “It’s a really very real thing to feel like there’s a black cloud that is following you wherever you go telling you that you are worthless and should die,” she said, adding she used to “scream and throw myself against the wall.” ""You know why it’s not good to self-harm? Because it makes you feel worse. You think you’re going to feel better because you’re showing someone, 'Hey look I’m in pain,' (but) it doesn’t help,” she said. “I always tell people, tell somebody don’t show somebody.” That sentiment echoes throughout the entire show as Winfrey, Harry and others open up about their mental health journeys. From NBA player DeMar DeRozan to Olympic-bound boxer Ginny Fuchs who struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder, the series shows multiple people push through their pain to get to healing. ""The Me You Can't See"" premieres Friday on Apple TV+. If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, call the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673. The hotline, run by the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network (RAINN), can put you in contact with your local rape crisis center.

71," Sections TV Featured More from NBC  Follow NBC News  LONDON — Prince Harry has accused the British royal family of ""total neglect"" and revealed he turned to alcohol and drugs years after the death of his mother, Princess Diana. The Duke of Sussex made the comments as he once again opened up about his mental health to the American media mogul Oprah Winfrey in a new interview released Friday. The pair delve into Harry's personal life — from his trauma in the wake of his mother's death to his experience with therapy and recent royal feuds. ""I felt completely helpless,"" he said, speaking about the press scrutiny he and his wife, Meghan, faced. ""I thought my family would help — but every single ask, request, warning, whatever it is, just got met with total silence or total neglect."" Buckingham Palace declined to comment Friday in response to a request from NBC News. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics The revelations feature in a new documentary series executive produced by both Harry and Winfrey, ""The Me You Can't See,"" which arrives on Apple TV+ on Friday. Harry said he hoped speaking out would help alleviate the social stigma surrounding mental health. The last time Harry and Winfrey spoke — alongside Meghan — it sent shockwaves from Los Angeles to Buckingham Palace. The couple relocated to the United States last year after breaking away from royal duties. In that March interview, the couple stunned millions of viewers with allegations of royal racism — denied by the palace — while Meghan also spoke publicly about how royal life and media pressure had driven her to thoughts of suicide. For Harry, that carried clear echoes of his mother's fate. ""The clicking of cameras and the flash of cameras makes my blood boil. It makes me angry. It takes me back to what happened to my mum, what I experienced as a kid,"" he tells Winfrey in the documentary. ""I was so angry with what happened to her, and the fact that there was no justice at all ... The same people that chased her through that tunnel photographed her dying on the back seat of that car."" Diana, Princess of Wales, died in the car crash in Paris in 1997 when Harry was 12. He says he was told by his father, Prince Charles, in the aftermath of Diana's death that media attention and being part of the institution was something he had to get used to. ""That doesn't make sense. Just because you suffered, it doesn't mean that your kids have to suffer. In fact, quite the opposite,"" Harry says in the documentary. ""Isn't this all about breaking the cycle?,"" he adds. Even now, at age 36, Harry said that returning to London earlier this year for the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip, made him feel tense and anxious. In the five-part documentary series, Harry is seen undergoing a form of therapy known as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) to treat unresolved anxiety stemming from his anger at the media and the death of his mother. Diana made global headlines of her own in a bombshell 1995 interview with the BBC in which she famously told journalist Martin Bashir, ""there were three of us in this marriage,"" referring to her husband's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles. An independent report published Thursday after a monthslong probe found that Bashir acted inappropriately and breached the publicly funded broadcaster's editorial guidelines in order to gain access to Diana. Reacting late Thursday, Harry and his brother, Prince William, pressed for higher standards in the news media after the report found the BBC had acted to cover up the journalist's ""deceitful behavior."" Bashir later worked for MSNBC. Both he and the BBC apologized after the report's release, though Bashir noted that Diana had said she had no regrets over the interview. William said it had brought him ""indescribable sadness"" to know that lies presented to his mother contributed to the ""fear, paranoia and isolation"" that plagued Diana in the years prior to her death. The documentary also sees Harry tell Winfrey that as an adult he, at times, turned to excessive alcohol and drugs. ""I was willing to drink, I was willing to take drugs, I was willing to try and do the things that made me feel less like I was feeling,"" he said. ""Not because I was enjoying it but because I was trying to mask something,"" he added. He also discusses first seeing a therapist approximately four years ago at the encouragement of Meghan. They'd had an argument and she recognized his anger seemed misplaced, he said. The documentary includes contributions from 14 health experts and is intended to have a global reach. Other celebrities have taken part in the series including actress Glenn Close and singer Lady Gaga, along with Syrian refugees and others who have experienced mental trauma. Winfrey also discusses her childhood, which saw her whipped by her grandmother, made to sleep on an outdoor porch by her mother and raped by a cousin at age 9. Telling her story was crucial to her ability to process it, she said.  Adela Suliman is a London-based reporter for NBC News Digital.  © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"
72," Sections TV Featured More from NBC  Follow NBC News  What streaming service is that show on? It's a question that has begun to dog consumers in the modern streaming age. It's also one that could eventually become a lot simpler if media mergers heat up.  AT&T's announcement on Monday that it had struck a deal to spin off WarnerMedia, the owner of HBO, CNN, TNT and several other major media businesses, and combine it with Discovery, a sizable media operation in its own right with Food Network, HGTV, the Oprah Winfrey Network, Travel Channel and others, became one of the first major media mergers of the streaming age.  It combines two streaming operations that were sizable but still small compared to the likes of Netflix and Disney. The move hints at what analysts and media industry experts say is a move toward consolidation.  The expectation is for more mergers and acquisitions soon.  ""It's going to put pressure on everyone else,"" Craig Moffett, of the research company MoffettNathanson, said of the AT&T deal on Yahoo Finance Live. ""Netflix knew they were going to have to compete against some big players. And clearly that means Discovery will be one of those big players. Amazon, I think, just by virtue of who they are was going to be one of those big players."" Some talks were already underway. In recent weeks, Amazon has been in talks to acquire MGM, the movie studio behind the James Bond and Rocky franchises, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. Technology industry publication The Information first reported the talks. A deal would give Amazon more than 4,000 film titles and 17,000 television episodes to add to its streaming library. Apple and Comcast have also eyed MGM, two sources said. The emergence of the streaming industry quickly gave rise to dozens of companies looking to offer services ranging from niche interests like anime and horror movies to bundles from major media companies such as NBCUniversal's Peacock or ViacomCBS' Paramount+. NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC News.  And while the pick-and-choose nature of the businesses offered consumers some upside when compared to the all-or-nothing cable bundle, it had already become a chore to figure out how to watch a particular show — and whether it was something worth paying for month after month.  It's an issue that may in part be fixed by the need for streaming services to be bigger — both in terms of the libraries of content they hold but also the amount of money they can spend on new content. ""I think everybody is concluding that to play in this streaming business is really hard and really expensive,"" said Paul Hardart, a professor of marketing at New York University and the director of its entertainment, media and technology program. ""And you need scale, and I think you will start to see more of these companies combining to see that scale because it's a very, very expensive game."" That volume of offerings could offer some advantages to consumers, much as the cable bundle once offered upside for being a one-stop shop, albeit an expensive one. Rajkumar Venkatesan, a professor of business administration at the University of Virginia, who focuses on analytics, said the consolidation is part of a natural cycle. Streaming platforms offered an unbundled experience that could deliver on-demand content in a better way than cable packages. But now that those experiences are becoming commoditized, they're starting to rebundle.  Along the way, some media companies once seen as major players — NBC and CBS among them — can no longer rely on their size. ""These are big brands in the old world but they are smaller than Netflix and Disney in the new world,"" Venkatesan said.  That means even a sizable media operation like Comcast's NBCUniversal could be in need of more content. Media analysts have speculated that Comcast could look to pull a maneuver similar to AT&T’s by combining NBCUniversal with another large media company. ""The big questions now are (1) Why did Comcast not take a shot at trying to merge NBCU with WarnerMedia? and (2) Will Comcast follow AT&T’s lead and spin-off NBCU and merge with another media company?"" wrote the technology, media and telecommunications research firm LightShed Partners in a blog post following the announcement of the Discovery deal. LightShed has aggressively advocated for media consolidation to compete with Netflix and Disney. A spokesperson for Comcast declined to comment. NBCUniversal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. For consumers, that means the fractured streaming experience could become more streamlined. And with more content, companies will operate with more user data, which Venkatesan said could mean better automated recommendations and targeted content creation. He also suggested a few major players will have to compete on price to retain customers. But that's not a foregone conclusion, and there are already indications that the U.S. government will take a close look at the WarnerMedia deal to make sure it is good for consumers. Critics of consolidation have argued that prices for consumers have steadily risen because larger companies have less competition. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., tweeted Monday afternoon that the deal ""demands close scrutiny to protect consumers' pocket books instead of accelerating further concentration among corporate behemoths."" ""Recent lax antitrust enforcement has allowed a dramatic consolidation in the media market that is driving up prices & limiting consumer choice,"" Blumenthal added. ""TV viewers & sports lovers deserve more choices about how they get their entertainment, better competition over services & lower prices."" Some in the entertainment industry have said that consolidation is changing the work that is made. Writing in The New York Times in 2019, director Martin Scorsese offered a warning. ""The situation, sadly, is that we now have two separate fields: There’s worldwide audiovisual entertainment, and there’s cinema,"" he wrote. ""They still overlap from time to time, but that’s becoming increasingly rare. And I fear that the financial dominance of one is being used to marginalize and even belittle the existence of the other.""

73," Sections TV Featured More from NBC  Follow NBC News  Many of the world's largest cybercrime gangs are still actively hacking and extorting victims, undeterred by the international spotlight after one of their peers hacked a U.S. fuel pipeline. A Russian-affiliated hacker gang, DarkSide, disappeared last week after it hacked Colonial Pipeline, which provides fuel for much of the U.S. East Coast. That prompted the company to shut down operations for five days, leading to gas shortages in the U.S. and condemnation from President Joe Biden. Seemingly spooked, DarkSide, which had collected around $5 million in ransom from the company, claimed that it was ""apolitical"" on its main website, which soon was deleted. But DarkSide is only one player in a thriving scene of cybercrime groups. More notorious gangs are still active after the Colonial attack, according to evidence of their exploits, which many such groups post to blogs that they maintain on the dark web.  The groups continue to post information from victims they have hacked and are actively extorting U.S. organizations. Like DarkSide, such gangs make money by infecting organizations with ransomware, meaning they hack them to encrypt and steal files. They demand money to make their files usable, threatening to publish private files if they're not promptly paid. An effective ransomware attack can net the hackers millions of dollars. Although some gangs, like DarkSide, code their hacking programs not to attack Russian victims, many ransomware groups have few qualms about whom they hit, as long as they can potentially turn a profit. A gang with a track record of hacking hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic has in recent months devastated a hospital that serves the Navajo Nation and published sensitive patient files from other U.S. hospitals that didn't promptly pay up. Last week, it also hacked Ireland's national health care system, the Health Service Executive, or HSE, a spokesperson confirmed by text message. The service's email server is still offline because of the attack. The attack, which the HSE announced Friday, has led to a number of appointment cancellations across six Irish hospitals. Ireland's minister for public procurement and e-government, Ossian Smyth, said it was ""possibly the most significant cybercrime attack on the Irish state."" The gang has been active with extortion attempts on its website. Since May 13, it has published files from Bee County, Texas, a Utah farming equipment manufacturer, an Australian butcher chain and an Indian travel technology company, all as punishment for not paying. Another prolific group is most recently known for hacking a Taiwanese company that manufactures Apple computers and leaking previously private specs. Since Saturday, it has posted proof of at least four new victims to a dark web blog it maintains: a California sensor manufacturer, a Texas home construction company, a Florida law firm and an international customer experience consulting company. A third gang last week published a vast trove of documents stolen from Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department after police were reported to have offered only $100,000 to keep them private.  It leaked files from two more victims Friday: a New Jersey LED light manufacturer and the U.S. arm of a Swiss automation company. Websites for two smaller ransomware gangs went down over the weekend, prompting some speculation that DarkSide's disappearance marked the beginning of cybercriminals' facing consequences for their sprees. But the reality is probably more bland, said Allan Liska, a ransomware analyst at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. ""The most likely scenario is that DarkSide, rightfully, feared they had attracted too much attention, so they decided to shut down operations and drain their accounts,"" Liska said. The other groups ""were second-tier players — they won't be missed."" Kevin Collier is a reporter covering cybersecurity, privacy and technology policy for NBC News. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL"

75," Sections TV Featured More from NBC  Follow NBC News  In the last decade, Bill Gates cultivated a straightforward public image. He earned a reputation as a visionary global philanthropist. He drew wide attention as a self-styled expert on Covid-19. He endeared himself to self-proclaimed nerds as they ascended in popular culture, even making a cameo appearance on the sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory."" But in the wake of the announcement that Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, and his wife, Melinda French Gates, plan to divorce after 27 years of marriage, a series of news reports have complicated his celebrity persona and raised questions about his personal life. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Sunday that Gates left the Microsoft board last year during an investigation into a romantic relationship with a female company employee that was deemed inappropriate. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson said that in 2019 the company was made aware of a concern that Gates ""sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year 2000."" Gates' spokesperson confirmed that ""there was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably."" ""Bill's decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter,"" the spokesperson said. (Gates said last year that he was stepping down from the board ""to dedicate more time to philanthropic priorities."") The New York Times, citing people with direct knowledge of Gates' behavior, reported Sunday that he pursued women who worked for him at Microsoft and at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, creating what were described as uncomfortable work environments. NBC News has not independently confirmed that report, and a spokesperson for Gates said in part that ""the claim of mistreatment of employees is also false."" The Journal and The Times have both reported that French Gates was uncomfortable with her husband's ties to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — a friendship that was reported to have begun in 2011, three years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor. However, a spokesperson for Gates said he ""had absolutely no business partnership or personal friendship with Epstein,"" adding, ""Gates never socialized with Epstein or attended parties with him."" The reports about Gates' personal life threaten to overshadow his carefully crafted image as a global do-gooder who, in an era of yawning economic inequality, harnessed his immense fortune (a net worth of about $130 billion, according to Forbes) for ambitious charitable projects and scientific research. The wider culture, shaped in part by the #MeToo movement and national attention on gender and the workplace, is reckoning with the reputations of influential people across the arts, politics, business and other industries. New questions about Gates' connections to Epstein — the reason French Gates was meeting with divorce attorneys as early as 2019, according to The Journal — could put Gates' private life under particularly intense examination. In the last 20 years, as much of the American public continued to lose faith in traditional institutions, Gates appeared to gain more authority, helping to lead the fight against malaria and pushing for scientific research around the world. Gates, along with French Gates and the U2 rocker Bono, were named Time magazine's ""Persons of the Year"" in 2005 in honor of their philanthropic activities. The magazine labeled the trio ""The Good Samaritans."" Gates, who warned for years about the possibility of a global disease outbreak, recently emerged as a widely heard voice as the world confronted the scourge of Covid-19, speaking frequently about U.S. testing capabilities and offering predictions about the course of the pandemic. ""The U.S. would not take the issue of global vaccine equity as seriously if it weren't for Bill Gates, because, through media appearances, he was bringing attention to global cooperation,"" said Dr. Kavita Patel, a primary care physician in Washington and a scholar at the Brookings Institution. ""He speaks in a voice of authority for United States health professionals,"" said Patel, who worked in the Obama administration. And yet Gates' professional conduct at Microsoft was not without criticism. In the late 1990s, Gates was faulted for the company's aggressive tactics, including maneuvers that some considered anticompetitive. The saga culminated in a notable antitrust legal case in 2001. He was also said to have an occasionally combative management style. In a 1997 article for Time magazine titled ""In Search of the Real Bill Gates,"" the writer Walter Isaacson reported that one of Gates' favorite phrases inside the company was ""That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard."" Gates has long been linked in public consciousness with Apple impresario Steve Jobs. Gates and Jobs, the so-called ""Pirates of Silicon Valley,"" revolutionized the personal computing industry — but Jobs' decidedly complicated personal life usually drew more significant attention.

Regardless, we have a grip of startup news to get to, so off we go! — Alex To round out the week, how about a few smaller venture capital rounds? We have a number from today that are well worth our time: Secai Marche raises $1.4M for farm-to-table food distribution: We don’t cover enough Japanese startups, frankly, but here’s to doing better. Tokyo-based Secai Marche is building a B2B “logistics platform for farmers that sell to restaurants, hotels and other” food and beverage companies, and we think it’s neat. Rakuten and Beyond Next supplied the capital. Mio raises $1M to bring social commerce to rural Vietnam: Quickly growing e-commerce market Vietnam is seeing rising penetration in major cities. Mio wants to bring e-commerce to smaller cities and rural areas. Per our reporting, it is “building a reseller network and logistics infrastructure that can offer next-day delivery to Tier 2 and 3 cities.” Our present may be someone else’s future, so it’s swell to see startups bring the latest to more folks. To round out our round coverage today, a slightly larger deal for a mental-health focused service: Wysa raises $5.5M for AI-powered mental health: This is at a minimum cool on paper. We’ll have to get some time with the service as it evolves through time, but TechCrunch reports that “Jo Aggarwal, the founder and CEO of Wysa, is hoping you’ll find it easier to confide in a robot. Or, put more specifically, “‘emotionally intelligent’ artificial intelligence.” I, for one, welcome our robot mental-health overlords. Jokes aside, there is a therapist shortage in the world, and if Wysa can help more folks handle their mental health better, we’re all for it. The United States is one of the world’s most advanced economies, but until quite recently, South Korea and China had much higher e-commerce penetration. American consumers and companies are closing that gap. In 2016, the percentage of total retail spend where the goods were bought and sold online in the U.S. was about 8%. Today, that figure is closer to 17%. Despite the last two decades of disruption, we’re still in the early days of e-commerce. But as more merchants of every size start making their goods and services available online, we’ve reached an inflection point.

The Indian government is mad at tech companies yet again. This time it’s Twitter’s turn. Per TechCrunch, New Delhi “has expressed strong objection to Twitter for classifying tweets by Indian politicians as ‘manipulated media,’ and separately asked social media firms to remove posts that refer to an ‘Indian variant’ of the coronavirus.” A few thoughts here: One, Twitter is going to have to navigate an increasingly complicated global climate for free speech in general. And figure out how to handle governments’ reactions to its decisions on labeling content. That’s going to be hard. And asking a social service to blanket-ban a particular phrase is going to be essentially impossible. After all, even in China, where banned phrases on social media are common, individuals have found myriad ways around the restrictions. So, good luck, Indian government.

78,"With vaccination rates slowing in the U.S., the White House is getting creative about getting shots in arms. Beyond protecting yourself and others from a deadly disease, the latest incentive to get vaccinated could help you find love (or get laid). The White House COVID-19 response team announced Friday that a number of popular dating apps would offer new perks for users who get vaccinated, with Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Match, OkCupid, BLK, Chispa, Plenty of Fish and Badoo all participating in the promotional push. The White House hopes to make inroads with the 50 million users across those dating apps where they’re already spending time. On Tinder, anyone who adds a sticker to their profile promoting their vaccination status between June 2 and July 4 will be gifted a free Super Like. (Proof of vaccination isn’t necessary, but really, you should get vaccinated if it’s available where you live.) Tinder and other apps will also add vaccination site resources from Vaccine.gov to help people figure out where they can get the shot nearby.  “Nothing like fireworks to signal a new spark and a new start for those looking to meet new people IRL this summer,” Tinder CEO Jim Lanzone said. According to OkCupid, getting vaccinated might help with that. The company found that people who displayed their vaccination status were 14% more likely to find a match. On OkCupid, vaccinated users will get a free boost, a perk that promotes their profile to potential matches. The other apps participating in the White House initiative are handing out their own premium perks to give users a competitive edge. Running a queer dating startup amid a pandemic and racial justice uprising  The effort is part of a push by the White House to get 70% of adults vaccinated by the Fourth of July. To reach more Americans, the Biden administration has also coordinated with popular entertainment companies like NASCAR and country music channel CMT to promote vaccination. “Social distancing and dating were always a bit of a challenging combination,” White House Senior COVID Advisor Andy Slavitt said during a press event Friday. He characterized the vaccine push through dating apps as those companies “responding to the president’s call to action” rather than calling it an official partnership. “We have finally found the one thing that makes us all more attractive,” Slavitt said. “A vaccination.” Snack, a ‘Tinder meets TikTok’ dating app, opens to Gen Z investors "
79,"Apple CEO Tim Cook took his first turn in the witness chair this morning in what is probably the most anticipated testimony of the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. But rather than a fiery condemnation of Epic’s shenanigans and allegations, Cook offered a mild, carefully tended ignorance that left many of the lawsuit’s key questions unanswered, or unanswerable. This anticlimax may not make for exciting reporting, but it could serve to defang the dangerous, if somewhat dubious, argument that Apple’s App Store amounts to a monopoly. Epic cries monopoly as Apple details secret ‘Project Liberty’ effort to provoke ‘Fortnite’ ban  After being called by Apple’s own attorneys, Cook took the stand, Law360’s Dorothy Atkins, one of two media members allowed in the court, reported in her comprehensive live tweeting of the testimony. The quotes from Cook are as reported and not to be considered verbatim; the court transcript will follow when the document is compiled and public. Incidentally, Atkins’ stage-setting descriptions are appealing and humanizing, though Epic CEO Tim Sweeney comes off as a bit weird: Sweeney is sitting at Epic's counsel table looking down at his pen. His lawyer Gary Bornstein sporadically whispers in his ear. Cook seems relaxed, legs crossed. Just turned to someone sitting next took him, said something and then laughed. — these trying times. (@doratki) May 21, 2021  The questioning of Cook by his own company’s counsel was gentle and directed at reiterating the reasons why Apple’s App Store is superior and sufficient for iOS users, while also asserting the presence of stiff competition. He admitted to a handful of conflicts with developers, such as differing priorities or needing to improve discovery, but said the company works constantly to retain developers and users. The façade of innocent ignorance began when he was asked about Apple’s R&D numbers — $15-20 billion annually for the last three years. Specifically, he said that Apple couldn’t estimate how much of that money was directed toward the App Store, because “we don’t allocate like that,” i.e. research budgets for individual products aren’t broken out from the rest. Now, that doesn’t sound right, does it? A company like Apple knows down to the penny how much it spends on its products and research. Even if it can’t be perfectly broken down — an advance in MacOS code may play into a feature on the App Store — the company must know to some extent how its resources are being deployed and to what effect. The differences between a conservative and liberal estimation of the App Store’s R&D allocation might be large, in the hundreds of millions perhaps, but make no mistake, those estimations are almost certainly being made internally. To do otherwise would be folly. But because the numbers are not publicly declared and broken down, and because they are likely to be somewhat fuzzy, Cook can say truthfully that there’s no single number like (to invent an amount) “App Store R&D was $500 million in 2019.” Not having a hard number removes a potential foothold for Epic, which could use it either way: If it’s big, they’re protecting their golden goose (enforcing market power). If it’s small, they’re just collecting the eggs (collecting rent via market power). Apple’s only winning move is not to play, so Cook plays dumb and consequently Epic’s argument looks like speculation (and, as Apple would argue, fabulation). He then deployed a similar strategy of starving the competition with a preemptive shrug about profits. He only addressed total net sales, which were about $275 billion at a 21% profit margin, saying Apple does not evaluate the App Store’s income as a standalone business. Certainly it is arguable that the App Store is very much a tightly integrated component of a larger business structure. But the idea that it cannot be assessed as a standalone business is ludicrous. It is again nearly certain that it, like all of Apple’s divisions and product lines, is dissected and reported internally in excruciating detail. But again it is just plausible that for legal purposes it is not straightforward enough to say “the income and profits of the App Store are such and such,” thus denying Epic its datum. Apple App Store customers spent $1.8B over the week of Christmas, set a spending record on New Year’s Day  However, the point is important enough that Epic thought it warranted independent investigation. And among the first things Epic’s attorney brought up, when the witness was turned over to him, was the testimony from earlier in the trial by an expert witness that Apple’s App Store operating margins were around 79%. It was not in Apple’s interest to confirm or deny these numbers, and Cook again pleaded ignorance. The mask slipped a tiny bit, however, when Epic’s attorney asked Cook to break down the confidential income numbers that combined the Mac and iOS App Stores. While Apple objected to this, saying it was privileged information and could only be divulged in a closed court, Cook offered that the iOS numbers are “a lot larger” than the Mac numbers. What we see here is another piece of financial sleight-of-hand. By mixing the iOS and Mac income Apple gets to muddy the waters of how much money is made and spent in and on them. Epic’s attempt to unmix them was not successful, but the judge is no fool — she sees the same things Epic does, but just as dimly. Apple is attempting to deny Epic a legal victory even at the cost of looking rather shadowy and manipulative. This was further demonstrated when Cook was asked about Apple’s deal with Google that keeps the search engine as the default on iOS. Cook said he didn’t remember the specific numbers. If the CEO of one of the biggest tech companies in the world told you they forgot the specifics of a multibillion-dollar, decade-long deal with one of the other biggest tech companies in the world, would you believe them? Apple search crawler activity could signal a Google competitor, or a bid to make Siri a one-stop shop  Little of the remaining testimony shed light on anything. Cook discussed the complexities of operating in places like China where local laws have technical and policy repercussions, and minimized the assertion that Apple had expanded the scope of in-app purchases and from which transactions the company gets a 30% cut. A bit more testimony will take place in a closed court, but we likely won’t hear about it as it will concern confidential information. The trial, which is winding down, has held few surprises; both sides laid out their arguments at the start, and much of this will come down to the judge’s interpretation of the facts. There were no dramatic surprise witnesses or smoking guns — it’s simply a novel argument about what constitutes monopolistic behavior. Apple is adamant that competition is present and fierce in Android, and that in the gaming world it competes with Windows and consoles as well. It seems almost inevitable that whatever the judgment is, the case will be appealed and brought to a higher court, but that judgment will also be a strong indicator of how well Epic’s arguments (and Apple’s obfuscations) have been received. That said, Epic and other critics of Apple’s App Store fees, which are immensely profitable however the company chooses to obscure it, have arguably already accomplished their goals. Apple’s lowered 15% fee for the first million dollars is plainly a response to developer unrest and bad press, and now it is put in the position of defending how the sausage gets made. Tarnishing Apple’s anodized aluminum tower was always at least partly the intent, and win or lose Epic may feel it has gotten its money’s worth. Besides, the rematch in Europe is yet to come. Epic Games takes its Apple App Store fight to Europe "

Epic cries monopoly as Apple details secret ‘Project Liberty’ effort to provoke ‘Fortnite’ ban  After being called by Apple’s own attorneys, Cook took the stand, Law360’s Dorothy Atkins, one of two media members allowed in the court, reported in her comprehensive live tweeting of the testimony. The quotes from Cook are as reported and not to be considered verbatim; the court transcript will follow when the document is compiled and public. Incidentally, Atkins’ stage-setting descriptions are appealing and humanizing, though Epic CEO Tim Sweeney comes off as a bit weird: Sweeney is sitting at Epic's counsel table looking down at his pen. His lawyer Gary Bornstein sporadically whispers in his ear. Cook seems relaxed, legs crossed. Just turned to someone sitting next took him, said something and then laughed. — these trying times. (@doratki) May 21, 2021  The questioning of Cook by his own company’s counsel was gentle and directed at reiterating the reasons why Apple’s App Store is superior and sufficient for iOS users, while also asserting the presence of stiff competition. He admitted to a handful of conflicts with developers, such as differing priorities or needing to improve discovery, but said the company works constantly to retain developers and users. The façade of innocent ignorance began when he was asked about Apple’s R&D numbers — $15-20 billion annually for the last three years. Specifically, he said that Apple couldn’t estimate how much of that money was directed toward the App Store, because “we don’t allocate like that,” i.e. research budgets for individual products aren’t broken out from the rest. Now, that doesn’t sound right, does it? A company like Apple knows down to the penny how much it spends on its products and research. Even if it can’t be perfectly broken down — an advance in MacOS code may play into a feature on the App Store — the company must know to some extent how its resources are being deployed and to what effect. The differences between a conservative and liberal estimation of the App Store’s R&D allocation might be large, in the hundreds of millions perhaps, but make no mistake, those estimations are almost certainly being made internally. To do otherwise would be folly. But because the numbers are not publicly declared and broken down, and because they are likely to be somewhat fuzzy, Cook can say truthfully that there’s no single number like (to invent an amount) “App Store R&D was $500 million in 2019.” Not having a hard number removes a potential foothold for Epic, which could use it either way: If it’s big, they’re protecting their golden goose (enforcing market power). If it’s small, they’re just collecting the eggs (collecting rent via market power). Apple’s only winning move is not to play, so Cook plays dumb and consequently Epic’s argument looks like speculation (and, as Apple would argue, fabulation). He then deployed a similar strategy of starving the competition with a preemptive shrug about profits. He only addressed total net sales, which were about $275 billion at a 21% profit margin, saying Apple does not evaluate the App Store’s income as a standalone business. Certainly it is arguable that the App Store is very much a tightly integrated component of a larger business structure. But the idea that it cannot be assessed as a standalone business is ludicrous. It is again nearly certain that it, like all of Apple’s divisions and product lines, is dissected and reported internally in excruciating detail. But again it is just plausible that for legal purposes it is not straightforward enough to say “the income and profits of the App Store are such and such,” thus denying Epic its datum. Apple App Store customers spent $1.8B over the week of Christmas, set a spending record on New Year’s Day  However, the point is important enough that Epic thought it warranted independent investigation. And among the first things Epic’s attorney brought up, when the witness was turned over to him, was the testimony from earlier in the trial by an expert witness that Apple’s App Store operating margins were around 79%. It was not in Apple’s interest to confirm or deny these numbers, and Cook again pleaded ignorance. The mask slipped a tiny bit, however, when Epic’s attorney asked Cook to break down the confidential income numbers that combined the Mac and iOS App Stores. While Apple objected to this, saying it was privileged information and could only be divulged in a closed court, Cook offered that the iOS numbers are “a lot larger” than the Mac numbers. What we see here is another piece of financial sleight-of-hand. By mixing the iOS and Mac income Apple gets to muddy the waters of how much money is made and spent in and on them. Epic’s attempt to unmix them was not successful, but the judge is no fool — she sees the same things Epic does, but just as dimly. Apple is attempting to deny Epic a legal victory even at the cost of looking rather shadowy and manipulative. This was further demonstrated when Cook was asked about Apple’s deal with Google that keeps the search engine as the default on iOS. Cook said he didn’t remember the specific numbers. If the CEO of one of the biggest tech companies in the world told you they forgot the specifics of a multibillion-dollar, decade-long deal with one of the other biggest tech companies in the world, would you believe them? Apple search crawler activity could signal a Google competitor, or a bid to make Siri a one-stop shop  Little of the remaining testimony shed light on anything. Cook discussed the complexities of operating in places like China where local laws have technical and policy repercussions, and minimized the assertion that Apple had expanded the scope of in-app purchases and from which transactions the company gets a 30% cut. A bit more testimony will take place in a closed court, but we likely won’t hear about it as it will concern confidential information. The trial, which is winding down, has held few surprises; both sides laid out their arguments at the start, and much of this will come down to the judge’s interpretation of the facts. There were no dramatic surprise witnesses or smoking guns — it’s simply a novel argument about what constitutes monopolistic behavior. Apple is adamant that competition is present and fierce in Android, and that in the gaming world it competes with Windows and consoles as well. It seems almost inevitable that whatever the judgment is, the case will be appealed and brought to a higher court, but that judgment will also be a strong indicator of how well Epic’s arguments (and Apple’s obfuscations) have been received. That said, Epic and other critics of Apple’s App Store fees, which are immensely profitable however the company chooses to obscure it, have arguably already accomplished their goals. Apple’s lowered 15% fee for the first million dollars is plainly a response to developer unrest and bad press, and now it is put in the position of defending how the sausage gets made. Tarnishing Apple’s anodized aluminum tower was always at least partly the intent, and win or lose Epic may feel it has gotten its money’s worth. Besides, the rematch in Europe is yet to come. Epic Games takes its Apple App Store fight to Europe "

85,"Apple last month unveiled its plans for paid podcast subscriptions in a newly redesigned Apple Podcasts app. Now, it’s introducing a new program that will help podcast creators grow their subscriber base: affiliate marketing. The company’s “Apple Services Performance Partner Program,” which already exists to help market other Apple services like Apple TV, Apple News and Apple Books, is today expanding to include paid podcasts. The new program — “Apple Services Performance Partner Program for Apple Podcasts” (whew!) — will be open to anyone, though the company believes it will make the most sense for publishers and creators who already have an audience and a number of marketing channels where they can share these new affiliate links. When users convert by clicking through one of the links and subscribe to a premium podcast, the partner will receive a one-time commission at 50% of the podcast subscription price, after the subscriber accumulates their first month of paid service. So, for example, if a paid podcast was charging subscribers $5 per month, the commission would be $2.50. This commission would apply for every new subscriber that signed up through the affiliate channel, and there’s no cap. Podcast creators can also use the affiliate links to promote their own paid programs, which would allow them to generate incremental revenue. Apple unveils podcast subscriptions and a redesigned Apple Podcasts app  While anyone can apply to join the affiliate program, there is an approval process involved. This is mainly about keeping spammers out of the program, and ensuring that those signing up do have at least some marketing channels where they can distribute the links. The sign-up form asks for specific criteria — like how many channels are available and how the partner intends to use them to promote the affiliate links, among other things. The program will be made available to anyone in the 170 countries and regions where paid podcasts subscriptions are being made available. Once approved and signed in, affiliate partners will gain access to an online dashboard where they can create links (i.e. shortened URLs) much like any other affiliate program. They can also create multiple URLs for an individual podcast to make it easier to track how well different channels are performing. The URLs can be posted on their own, tied to a “Listen on Apple Podcasts” badge, or can be made available as a QR code. The latter may make more sense when live events return, as it could be printed on signage or in flyers that were distributed during a live taping, for example. It also could be used in other sorts of advertising, including both print and digital. Though premium podcasts already existed, until more recently that often involved paying a podcaster directly to access a private RSS feed. Smaller services like Stitcher also used subscriptions to provide paying customers with a series of perks, like ad-free listening and exclusive content. The new efforts by both Apple and Spotify are focused on wooing creators to their platforms, where they’ll take a cut of the subscription revenues. Spotify is waiving its 5% fee for the first two years, while Apple is employing its usual model of 30% in year 1 that drops to 15% in year two. While people can begin to enroll in the new affiliate program starting today, paid podcasts aren’t actually launching until later this month, per Apple. When they do, those enrolled in the affiliate program will be able to create links and begin earning commissions on subscriptions. More thoughts on growing podcasts "

While products like Google Maps and Apple Maps have long-relied on data partners to juice the quality of their contextual insights, Snap is hoping it can give users a more hands-on approach to mixing and matching third-party tie-ins to its Snap Map product, allowing users to build a view of their geographic surroundings tailored to their interests. The new product — announced today at the company’s Snap Partner Summit — is called Layers and it allows users to add data from some of Snap’s chosen developer partners directly to their map so they can see the world in a very particular view. “Layers are how the Map evolves from a singular product to a platform,” Snap’s Bryant Detwiller tells TechCrunch. “Ultimately, we just want our map to be more useful.” Snap Map has aimed to be a fundamentally social product, designed around people and friends rather than cars and directions.

89,"I am not a smart man. Earlier today I tweeted about $ASS, a cryptocurrency named after a dog. In this case, Australian Shepherds. And after doing that obviously stupid thing, my Twitter feed became chock-full of ass-related imagery, memes and $ASS coin stans breathing on me. It’s all very annoying as I run Tweetdeck on a work laptop which is now very, well, dicey a proposition given what I’m being sent. save me pic.twitter.com/CtmjcfeWdX — alex (@alex) May 20, 2021  $ASS is short for Australian Safe Shepherd, by the by. It’s a cryptocurrency that, much like Dogecoin, is a joke. A joke that its own website doesn’t take too seriously. For example, if you navigate to AssFinance, you will find a very detailed look at $ASS’s technical underpinnings, and plans for the future:  I found this hilarious. So I tweeted about it. And then everyone in the $ASS world began to assault my Twitter. Pro-tip: This is not a good way to get taken seriously. But as $ASS is not trying to be taken seriously, does that even matter? The coin is effectively a limpid pump, a cryptocurrency designed to get early adopters to spread the word about it, and then hold. It built its economics around just those goals:  But enough of all that. Why do we give a shit about $ASS? A few reasons: As a concept, $ASS fits neatly into my budding view that as current generations of people in their 20s and 30s are desperate for a firmer foothold on a middle-class life than today’s wage-weak, healthcare-deficient and labor-unfriendly economy is willing to provide, moon-shots on speculative bullshit have outsized appeal compared to other times in American history when it was easier to afford a house. And while it’s hard to be serious about a butt dog-themed bit of internet money, $ASS is, well, very 2021. And who are we to pretend to be better than covering a shitcoin? Even if only to mock it. Bloomberg has more on $ASS if you want a more serious take about an unserious project."
90,"Google has explored storefronts for a while now. Here’s a pop-up in Manhattan’s SoHo district that we took a trip to some four+ years back. But the company’s own branded retail experience has been fairly limited — unsurprising, given that it has always been a software company first. This summer, however, the company is joining a growing number of tech companies that will their own retail stores. The first Google Store is opening in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood, in the former Port Authority building that also houses the company’s NY offices. The move follows in the footsteps of Apple and Samsung — both of whom have stores nearby (Amazon’s got its own book store, as well, but that’s further uptown near the Empire State Building). Like the competition, the shopping experience will center on Google hardware products first — that means things like Pixel phones and various Nest home devices. Google’s product offerings are still fairly limited compared to the likes of Apple and Samsung, though the recent closing of its Fitbit acquisition should go a ways toward offering a bit more variety in its brightly lit aisles. This year is a particularly weird time to open your first retail store. Google’s had a fair amount of retail space in Chelsea for a while now, but COVID-19 almost certainly put a damper on any plans to launch last year. Though, NYC has been pretty quick to vaccinate its massive population, with 41% of adults fully vaccinated as of earlier this month. 10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic  Still, Google is prioritizing safety here. Per a blog post: Masks, hand sanitation and social distancing will be required in the Google Store, and we’ll clean all spaces multiple times a day. The number of guests inside will be limited to ensure our customers feel safe during their shopping experience, and easy pickup options will also be available. We will continue to closely follow the guidance of the local and national authorities to adapt our health and safety procedures as needed. This sounds to be part of a bigger hardware push for the company, which has struggled of late — particularly in the mobile category. Google calls the first store, “an important next step in our hardware journey.” A trip to Google’s New York City Pop-Up Shop  "
91,"GPS is one of those science fiction technologies whose use is effortless for the end user and endlessly challenging for the engineers who design it. It’s now at the heart of modern life: everything from Amazon package deliveries to our cars and trucks to our walks through national parks are centered around a pin on a map that monitors us down to a few meters. Yet, GPS technology is decades old, and it’s going through a much-needed modernization. The U.S., Europe, China, Japan and others have been installing a new generation of GNSS satellites (GNSS is the generic name for GPS, which is the specific name for the U.S. system) that will offer stronger signals in what is known as the L5 band (1176 MHz). That means more accurate map pinpoints compared to the original generation L1 band satellites, particularly in areas where line-of-sight can be obscured, like urban areas. L5 was “designed to meet demanding requirements for safety-of-life transportation and other high-performance applications,” as the U.S. government describes it. It’s one thing to put satellites into orbit (that’s the easy part!), and another to build power-efficient chips that can scan for these signals and triangulate a coordinate (that’s the hard part!). So far, chipmakers have focused on creating hybrid chips that pull from the L1 and L5 bands simultaneously. For example, Broadcom recently announced the second-generation of its hybrid chip. OneNav has a totally different opinion on product design, and it placed it right in its name. Eschewing the hybrid chip model of mixing old signals with new, it wants one chip monitoring the singular band of L5 signals to drive cost and power savings for devices. One nav to rule them all, as it were. The company announced today that it has closed a $21 million Series B round led by Karim Faris at GV, which is solely funded by Alphabet. Other investors included Matthew Howard at Norwest and GSR Ventures, which invested in earlier rounds of the company. All together, OneNav has raised $33 million in capital and was founded about two years ago. CEO and co-founder Steve Poizner has been in the location business a long time. His previous company, SnapTrack, built out a GPS positioning technology for mobile devices that sold to Qualcomm for $1 billion in stock in March 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble. His co-founder and CTO at OneNav, Paul McBurney, has similarly spent decades in the GNSS space, most recently at Apple, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Image Credits: David McNew via Getty Images They saw an opportunity to build a new navigation company as L5 band satellites have switched on in recent years. As they looked at the market and the L5 tech, they decided they wanted to go further than other companies by eliminating the legacy tech of older GPS technology and moving entirely into the future. By doing that, its design is “half the size of the old system, but much higher reliability and performance,” Poizner said. “We are aiming to get location technology into a much broader number of products.” He differentiated between upgrading GPS from upgrading wireless signals. “With these L5 satellites, we don’t need the L1 satellites anymore [but] with 5G, you still need 4G,” he said. L5 band GPS does everything that earlier renditions did, but better, whereas with wireless technologies, they often need to complement each other to offer peak performance. There’s one caveat here: The L5 signal is still considered “pre-operational” by the U.S. government, since the U.S. GPS system only has 16 satellites broadcasting the signal today, and is targeting 24 satellites for full deployment by later in this decade. However, other countries have also deployed L5 GNSS satellites, which means that while it may not be fully operational from the U.S. government’s perspective, it may well be good enough for consumers. Micromobility’s next big business is software, not vehicles  OneNav’s goal according to Poizner is to be “the Arm of the GNSS space.” What he means is that like Arm, which produces the chip designs for nearly all mobile phones globally, OneNav creates comprehensive designs for L5 band GPS chips that can be integrated as a system-on-chip into the products of other manufacturers so that they can “embed a high-performance location engine based on their silicon.” The company today also announced that its first design customer will be In-Q-Tel, the U.S. intelligence community’s venture capital and business development organization. Poizner said that through In-Q-Tel, “we now have a development contract with a U.S. government agency.” The company is expecting that its customer evaluation units will be completed by the end of this year with the objective of potentially having OneNav’s technology in end-user devices by late 2022. Location tracking has become a major area of investment for venture capitalists, with companies working on a variety of technologies outside of GPS to offer additional detail and functionality where GPS falls short. Poizner sees these technologies as ultimately complementary to what he and his team are building at OneNav. “The better the GPS, the less pressure on these augmentation systems,” he said, while acknowledging that, “it is the case though that in certain environments [like downtown Manhattan or underground in a subway], you will never get the GPS to work.” For Poizner, it’s a bit of a return to entrepreneurship. Prior to starting OneNav, he had been heavily involved in California state politics. Several years after the sale of SnapTrack to Qualcomm, he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the California State Assembly. He later was elected California’s insurance commissioner in 2007 under former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He ran for governor in 2010, losing in the Republican primary against Meg Whitman, who made her name as the longtime head of eBay.

It’s now at the heart of modern life: everything from Amazon package deliveries to our cars and trucks to our walks through national parks are centered around a pin on a map that monitors us down to a few meters. Yet, GPS technology is decades old, and it’s going through a much-needed modernization. The U.S., Europe, China, Japan and others have been installing a new generation of GNSS satellites (GNSS is the generic name for GPS, which is the specific name for the U.S. system) that will offer stronger signals in what is known as the L5 band (1176 MHz). That means more accurate map pinpoints compared to the original generation L1 band satellites, particularly in areas where line-of-sight can be obscured, like urban areas. L5 was “designed to meet demanding requirements for safety-of-life transportation and other high-performance applications,” as the U.S. government describes it. It’s one thing to put satellites into orbit (that’s the easy part!), and another to build power-efficient chips that can scan for these signals and triangulate a coordinate (that’s the hard part!). So far, chipmakers have focused on creating hybrid chips that pull from the L1 and L5 bands simultaneously. For example, Broadcom recently announced the second-generation of its hybrid chip. OneNav has a totally different opinion on product design, and it placed it right in its name. Eschewing the hybrid chip model of mixing old signals with new, it wants one chip monitoring the singular band of L5 signals to drive cost and power savings for devices. One nav to rule them all, as it were. The company announced today that it has closed a $21 million Series B round led by Karim Faris at GV, which is solely funded by Alphabet. Other investors included Matthew Howard at Norwest and GSR Ventures, which invested in earlier rounds of the company. All together, OneNav has raised $33 million in capital and was founded about two years ago. CEO and co-founder Steve Poizner has been in the location business a long time. His previous company, SnapTrack, built out a GPS positioning technology for mobile devices that sold to Qualcomm for $1 billion in stock in March 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble. His co-founder and CTO at OneNav, Paul McBurney, has similarly spent decades in the GNSS space, most recently at Apple, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Image Credits: David McNew via Getty Images They saw an opportunity to build a new navigation company as L5 band satellites have switched on in recent years. As they looked at the market and the L5 tech, they decided they wanted to go further than other companies by eliminating the legacy tech of older GPS technology and moving entirely into the future. By doing that, its design is “half the size of the old system, but much higher reliability and performance,” Poizner said. “We are aiming to get location technology into a much broader number of products.” He differentiated between upgrading GPS from upgrading wireless signals. “With these L5 satellites, we don’t need the L1 satellites anymore [but] with 5G, you still need 4G,” he said. L5 band GPS does everything that earlier renditions did, but better, whereas with wireless technologies, they often need to complement each other to offer peak performance. There’s one caveat here: The L5 signal is still considered “pre-operational” by the U.S. government, since the U.S. GPS system only has 16 satellites broadcasting the signal today, and is targeting 24 satellites for full deployment by later in this decade. However, other countries have also deployed L5 GNSS satellites, which means that while it may not be fully operational from the U.S. government’s perspective, it may well be good enough for consumers. Micromobility’s next big business is software, not vehicles  OneNav’s goal according to Poizner is to be “the Arm of the GNSS space.” What he means is that like Arm, which produces the chip designs for nearly all mobile phones globally, OneNav creates comprehensive designs for L5 band GPS chips that can be integrated as a system-on-chip into the products of other manufacturers so that they can “embed a high-performance location engine based on their silicon.” The company today also announced that its first design customer will be In-Q-Tel, the U.S. intelligence community’s venture capital and business development organization. Poizner said that through In-Q-Tel, “we now have a development contract with a U.S. government agency.” The company is expecting that its customer evaluation units will be completed by the end of this year with the objective of potentially having OneNav’s technology in end-user devices by late 2022. Location tracking has become a major area of investment for venture capitalists, with companies working on a variety of technologies outside of GPS to offer additional detail and functionality where GPS falls short. Poizner sees these technologies as ultimately complementary to what he and his team are building at OneNav. “The better the GPS, the less pressure on these augmentation systems,” he said, while acknowledging that, “it is the case though that in certain environments [like downtown Manhattan or underground in a subway], you will never get the GPS to work.” For Poizner, it’s a bit of a return to entrepreneurship. Prior to starting OneNav, he had been heavily involved in California state politics. Several years after the sale of SnapTrack to Qualcomm, he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the California State Assembly. He later was elected California’s insurance commissioner in 2007 under former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He ran for governor in 2010, losing in the Republican primary against Meg Whitman, who made her name as the longtime head of eBay. He ran for his former seat of California insurance commissioner in 2018, this time as a political independent, but lost. OneNav is based in Palo Alto and currently has more than 30 employees."

It was another super-busy day in the tech world. I had my sights on Squarespace’s public debut, as well as the value of Coinbase’s stock, which may be tracking the price of bitcoin a bit more literally than some folks expected. And if you are a long-term crypto holder, congrats on the buying opportunity. If you are a short-term crypto holder, yes, you can have a drink now regardless of what time it is. — Alex From the TechCrunch Events side of things, Tess Hatch, a vice president and partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, is coming to Disrupt. Which is very hype. We’re shaking things up today and talking about product first and venture capital rounds second. Sound good? First up is Otter.ai’s new product: Otter Assistant. It can transcribe your Zoom calls. For reporters, this is huge as a note-taking tool. But it will likely find even broader remit in the business world. Don’t forget that Otter raised $50 million just a few months ago. (For more on the voice transcription space, check out Deepgram’s 2020-era funding round.) Second in the product category, Liquid Instruments has raised $13.7 million to bring its Moku:Go product to classrooms and labs everywhere. What does the Go do? It “combines several commonly used tools into one compact package, saving room on your workbench or classroom while also providing a modern, software-configurable interface,” TechCrunch reported. Moving onto some purely financial coverage from startup-land, here are four neat rounds we dug into more deeply: $20M for Assignar: Construction tech is a busy sector, not merely because the construction sector is itself rather active; the digital transformation push that we’ve seen around the business is also touching down in the world of mortar and bricks. Its software helps contractors and subcontractors “connect to the field and vice versa,” according to its CEO Sean McCreanor. $150M for Formlabs: 3D printing has come of age, it appears, as Massachusetts-based Formlabs closed a nine-figure round for its printing tech. SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 led the round, which values the company at around $2 billion. $50M for Super: If you own a home, you are familiar with how rapidly entropy will ensure that you have a regular stream of repair bills. Why not convert those into a monthly subscription? That’s what Super is working to do, and now it has cash to pursue its vision after growing 7x since last April. $250M for Pipe: Pipe is a platform that allows companies to sell their future, predictable revenue streams to investors. It’s best known for working with SaaS companies, but is expanding into other business types as well.

Today from the world of Big Tech, we’re pausing to listen to our own Editor in Chief Matthew Panzarino discuss the new iPad Pro, which he thinks has amazing hardware: But then there’s the software. Which Panzarino is not stoked about. It’s aging, he argues: The other side of this coin that isn’t so shiny is the iPad’s aging software. It’s just as good as it was when I wrote my review of the iPad Pro in 2020 — at which point my conclusions were “you can adapt to it but it could be better.” That was a year ago. As someone who has used it as my only portable machine for the last two and a half years, I can tell you that this is a very long time to wait for a big leap forward in capability. I have a very simple ask for the iPad’s software: I want to feel the same energy, vivacity and pure performance for the sake of peak performance that the hardware side exhibits. Apple has now come to the crossroad that Microsoft tried to meet with Windows 8 and failed; how do you build an OS that serves either two form factors (touch and mobile, and desktop) well, or two OSs that can share enough third-party software so that neither is neglected?

94,"Tapping the tiny screen of the Apple Watch with precision has a certain level of fundamental difficulty, but for some people with disabilities it’s genuinely impossible. Apple has remedied this with a new mode called “Assistive Touch” that detects hand gestures to control a cursor and navigate that way. The feature was announced as part of a collection of accessibility-focused additions across its products, but Assistive Touch seems like the one most likely to make a splash across the company’s user base. It relies on the built-in gyroscope and accelerometer, as well as data from the heart rate sensor, to deduce the position of the wrist and hand. Don’t expect it to tell a peace sign from a metal sign just yet, but for now it detects “pinch” (touching the index finger to the thumb) and “clench” (make a loose fist), which can act as basic “next” and “confirm” actions. Incoming calls, for instance, can be quickly accepted with a clench. Designing with accessibility in mind: a conversation  Most impressive, however, is the motion pointer. You can activate it either by selecting it in the Assistive Touch menu, or by shaking your wrist vigorously. It then detects the position of your hand as you move it around, allowing you to “swipe” by letting the cursor linger at the edge of the screen, or interact with things using a pinch or clench. Needless to say this could be extremely helpful for anyone who only has the one hand available for interacting with the watch. And even for those who don’t strictly need it, the ability to keep one hand on the exercise machine, cane or whatever else while doing smartwatch things is surely an attractive possibility. (One wonders about the potential of this control method as a cursor for other platforms as well…) Image Credits: Apple Image Credits: Apple Assistive Touch is only one of many accessibility updates Apple shared in this news release; other advances for the company’s platforms include: It’s all clustered around Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is tomorrow, May 20th.

95,"Ampere, the server startup that is betting on bringing Arm-based chips to the data center and edge, is hosting its annual media day today. With the 80-core Altra and 128-core Altra Max, the company already offers a platform that can rival and outperform those of competitors like Intel and AMD in many common scenarios — and Altra Max is now in production and shipping. Those chips are based on the standard ARM Neoverse N1 architecture, though. But now, it is about to launch its own custom  Ampere Cores, built on a 5nm process. “Altra and Altra Max are based on the N1 core from Arm. We’re an architecture licensee as well as an IP licensee, so we’re going to talk about our own core [at our media day]: what we built, how we built it, why we built it,” Ampere CEO Renee James, who spent 26 years at Intel before founding Ampere, told me. “And what does a cloud-native processor look like? We like to think about it like you think about M1 for a PC from Apple, you would think about an Ampere Core for a cloud data center server.” With the 128-core Altra Max, Ampere promises a chip that uses 50% less power per core compared to an AMD Rome CPU and performance gains of 1.6x for running the NGINX web server, for example. And all of those benchmarks look even better when compared to an Intel Cascade Lake Refresh CPU. AMD’s Rome launched in August 2019 and Intel’s Cascade Lake Scalable Performance Refresh CPU have been in the market since last February. “It’s all about developing that CPU that’s built for the cloud and making sure that we’re meeting the new — but not really not new anymore — but kind of the current and future needs of cloud-native workloads, that software development model, and that type of infrastructure deployment model,” Ampere’s CPO Jeff Wittich said. “Which for us really means developing a product that has high performance that’s very predictable across workloads across users and a very, very scalable platform for compute, memory, I/O, network, and that is very, very power efficient.” Image Credits: Ampere Image Credits: Ampere Wittich noted that Ampere had always planned to develop its own cores, in part because it offers a very specific product for a very specific use case. “We knew that from the start developing our own cores was going to be very, very important for us to innovate in the ways that we need to innovate,” he said. “I have to say the primary thing is that because we’re focused on cloud — and we’re not focused on a bunch of other markets, especially not client, and also not other markets, even within the server space — it means developing a core that’s specific to cloud is really important to us.” Ampere’s cloud customers want certain built-in security features and manageability features for performance and power, for example. And as Wittich stressed, those have to be built in at the micro-architecture level to work properly (and this allows the company to optimize performance, as well). “We have to build our own cores to actually have a processor that does what the cloud wants,” he said. The Ampere Cores will, for example, feature high I/O memory bandwidth, for example, but optimized for cloud use cases, not high-performance computing use cases. Image Credits: Ampere Image Credits: Ampere James echoed this, noting that customers want these features and Ampere’s competitors will offer them. “The cloud business is pretty specific and the customers are very demanding,” she said. “So cadence is really important and we are competing against customers who have really very good products.” It seems like this strategy is working out well for Ampere, which now counts the likes of Microsoft, Oracle and Tencent Cloud among its customers. Rumor has it that Microsoft is working on its own Arm-based chips as well, but interestingly, the company is also using Ampere’s media day to talk about how it is readying Azure for Altra. 2021 will be a calmer year for semiconductors and chips (except for Intel) "

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED 8/10 Unboxing the new 24-inch iMac isn't any different from the experience I went through last year when I tested Apple's 27-inch version of its all-in-one desktop computer. Yet the two machines feel poles apart. Maybe it's the fact that my partner and I spent a few minutes discussing which new iMac color would look best in the bedroom. Maybe it's the sheer lightweight and slim nature of the machine, or its many color-matching accessories. It just looks so pretty, I want to carve a space for it in my home. The 2021 version of the PC marks the first major redesign Apple has made to the iMac in years. It's just as simple to operate as before. Out of the box, accessories like the keyboard and mouse are already paired to the machine. All you need to do is find a space for the svelte body and plug in the magnetic power cord. It's one of the easiest setup experiences around, and (forgive me for this oft-used phrase) it just works. This approachability—which is certainly amplified by the aesthetics—is important, as Apple is touting this as a computer to be used by the whole family. It's also the first iMac with Apple's own M1 processor, and as we've seen from other M1 machines, the hardware is overall very reliable. That said, there are just a few quirks I hoped Apple would've addressed by now.  Look at all the colors. If you must know, my partner and I decided the yellow iMac would make a lovely contrast against our dark blue bedroom walls. Our second choice was purple, which was the test unit Apple sent my way. It's just as nice! Honestly, all tech should come in an array of colors that aren't black or white. (You can also opt for an iMac in green, pink, orange, silver, or blue.) I thought the white trim around the screen and the large “chin” below the display, which is where the computing components are housed, would bother me, but I don't mind them at all. They lend to this iMac's playful theme of looking and feeling nostalgic—like the Bondi Blue iMac of old— without looking dated. Before I talk about the iMac experience, I need to note that the base model has many omissions that make it a little tough to recommend. For $1,299, your only choices are blue, green, pink, or silver. Want the ability to connect an Ethernet cable instead of relying on wonky Wi-Fi? That option is an extra $30. Would you like the new Magic Keyboard that enables you to log in with Touch ID? Add $50 more, please. Biometric authentication shows up even in a $400 iPhone nowadays, so it's baffling that these basic features aren't in the base model. Plus, the cheapest model has only two USB-C ports instead of the four that come in the $1,499 version.  You'll definitely want to pay for Touch ID. It's integrated into the top-right part of the keyboard, just like it is on MacBooks, and it makes logging in to the machine and all your favorite apps and services so much easier. Plus, if you plan to add multiple accounts, as you might want to do on a family computer, each person just needs to hold their finger to the sensor to log in to their respective macOS user profile. The gigabit Ethernet add-on, which is implemented into the power adapter, is also worthwhile; a hardwired internet connection is always more reliable.  Apple iMac (24-Inch, 2021) Rating: 8/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED With those upgrades—oh, and the $50 Magic Trackpad instead of the awful Magic Mouse you still can't use as it charges—your total is $1,429. Touch ID, Ethernet, and a good mouse shouldn't be add-ons. At this point, the $1,499 model makes more sense because it includes Ethernet and Touch ID, plus more ports and an extra core for the graphics processing unit (a total of $1,549 with the upgrade to the trackpad). In any case, don't stick with the base iMac. Customize your order and add these features.  The two other upgrades worth considering are storage and RAM. Most folks may get by just fine with 256 gigabytes of storage, but you can add up to 1 terabyte. Similarly, the standard 8 gigs of RAM should be sufficient for most people, but you should know that there are zero ways to upgrade RAM in M1 Macs. If you're doing creative work with photos and videos, pay the $200 extra for 16 gigabytes. If not, 8 GB will more than satisfy, though having more RAM is always the safer option to future-proof your machine. The M1 chip inside is the same as the one in the 13-inch MacBook Pro, Air, and the Mac Mini. Unlike the Air, the iMac has a fan to dissipate heat, so it can eke out and sustain a tiny bit more power for heavier workloads. (The fan rarely turned on in my experience and is very, very quiet when it does switch on.) My benchmark tests show performance sitting smack dab between the Air and the Pro, which makes sense considering the M1 here is powering a larger and higher-resolution screen. It's more power than most people need—and that includes folks editing photos in Photoshop and Lightroom or editing 4K videos in Adobe Premiere and other video-editing software. Games like Arkham City and Transistor ran without hiccups, and even if a great number of apps are now optimized for the M1, I haven't had any trouble with software written for Intel-based machines.  The thing you'll be staring at the most, the 4,480- by 2,520-pixel LCD screen, looks great. It can get blindingly bright, colors look very natural, and it's wonderfully sharp. That said, I split my time watching the (ridiculously long) Snyder cut of Justice League between the iMac and the new iPad Pro, and I favored the experience on the latter. Apple's new Mini LED display tech in the iPad Pro produces nicer contrasts, with deeper blacks and brighter highlights. But it's something I noticed only with both screens side by side. As someone who usually uses an ultrawide monitor, the 24-inch screen on the iMac feels cramped. Still, I've been able to make it work, with Safari front and center and Slack and Telegram readily accessible in the background. (Note: You can only natively connect one external display on M1 machines, so if you wanted a triple-screen setup, you'll need to look at third-party workarounds.) I do miss the nano-texture glass Apple uses in the 27-inch iMac. I had that machine set up in the same exact spot now occupied by the new iMac, and I never saw any glare. That's not the case with this model. It would've been nice to have that glare-free glass as an optional add-on for people who can only place their iMac near a window.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED A bigger annoyance arises when you realize you can't adjust the height of the screen. You can only tilt the screen up toward your eyes by tugging the bottom edge forward. That's not ideal; for proper ergonomics, the top of your computer's display should be set at eye level, so being able to adjust the height is important. I currently have the iMac sitting on top of a stack of six books to boost the iMac's screen to the correct height. I am tall, but I shouldn't have to suffer, Apple! If you want to mount the whole iMac to an adjustable arm and gain the freedom to move the screen anywhere you want, you can. But you have to buy the version that only comes with a VESA mount preinstalled and does not include Apple's stand. It's silly that you have to make this decision at checkout. The webcam is the same 1080p camera in the 27-inch Mac, but Apple says the M1's image signal processor allows for better clarity, noise reduction, dynamic range, and smarter exposure. It would've been nice to get a privacy shutter to round out those improvements, but alas. Still, the image quality is pretty good. It's easily better than any other Mac webcam. My face comes up bright, and colors don't look muted despite me sitting in a dimly lit bedroom. I wouldn't go so far as to say it blew me away. It still looks slightly low-res. The bar for a good webcam is really low across the industry, so I'd have liked to see Apple go further here and leapfrog the competition. It's a similar story with the six speakers. The bass is underwhelming, but music and movies still sound great. However, too often I had the volume all the way up, whether during a Zoom meeting or when I was watching a show. It can fill up my small bedroom, but introduce some ambient noise, like the drone of an air conditioner or the TV in the living room, and you'll wish it could get louder.  The triple-mic array, on the other hand, captures my voice really well—good enough for the Gadget Lab podcast! Just make sure to remove the plastic wrap around the iMac before joining your Zoom meeting. I didn't notice the thin layer of protective film when I was unboxing the machine and was very confused when my editor said I sounded awful. Days went by before I realized my mics were still covered. The best part of using an iMac comes when you pair it with other Apple hardware. It always feels like magic when I can copy text on my iPhone and paste it on the iMac thanks to the universal clipboard. Or when I load up a Safari webpage on the iMac and immediately open it on the iPad with just a tap, then continue reading on the couch. This kind of seamlessness is nearly unmatched on any other ecosystem. Whether everyone in the household uses an Apple gadget or not, the new iMac is a great little machine that excels in its simplicity. Yes, you can buy cheaper machines, whether it's a Windows all-in-one, a PC you built, or even by just hooking up the M1-powered Mac Mini to another monitor and peripherals. But that all requires a bit of fussing.  You'll find little of that fussiness here. It's just pure, colorful bliss.

Last fall, Canadian student Colin Madland noticed that  Twitter’s automatic cropping algorithm continually selected his face—not his darker-skinned colleague’s—from photos of the pair to display in tweets. The episode ignited accusations of bias as a flurry of Twitter users published elongated photos to see whether the AI would choose the face of a white person over a Black person or if it focused on women’s chests over their faces. At the time, a Twitter spokesperson said assessments of the algorithm before it went live in 2018 found no evidence of race or gender bias. Now, the largest analysis of the AI to date has found the opposite: that Twitter’s algorithm favors white people over Black people. That assessment also found that the AI for predicting the most interesting part of a photo does not focus on women’s bodies over women’s faces. Previous tests by Twitter and researcher Vinay Prabhu involved a few hundred images or fewer. The analysis released by Twitter research scientists Wednesday is based on 10,000 image pairs of people from different demographic groups to test whom the algorithm favors. Researchers found bias when the algorithm was shown photos of people from two demographic groups. Ultimately, the algorithm picks one person whose face will appear in Twitter timelines, and some groups are better represented on the platform than others. When researchers fed a picture of a Black man and a white woman into the system, the algorithm chose to display the white woman 64 percent of the time and the Black man only 36 percent of the time, the largest gap for any demographic groups included in the analysis. For images of a white woman and a white man, the algorithm displayed the woman 62 percent of the time. For images of a white woman and a Black woman, the algorithm displayed the white woman 57 percent of the time. On May 5, Twitter did away with image cropping for single photos posted using the Twitter smartphone app, an approach Twitter chief design officer Dantley Davis favored since the algorithm controversy erupted last fall. The change led people to post tall photos and signaled the end of “open for a surprise” tweets. The so-called saliency algorithm is still in use on Twitter.com as well as for cropping multi-image tweets and creating image thumbnails. A Twitter spokesperson says excessively tall or wide photos are now center cropped, and the company plans to end use of the algorithm on the Twitter website. Saliency algorithms are trained by tracking what people look at when they look at an image. Other sites, including Facebook and Instagram, have used AI-based automated cropping. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Accusations of gender and race bias in computer vision systems are, unfortunately, fairly common. Google recently detailed efforts to improve how Android cameras work for people with dark skin. Last week the group Algorithm Watch found that image-labeling AI used on an iPhone labeled cartoon depictions of people with dark skin as “animal.” An Apple spokesperson declined to comment. Regardless of the results of fairness measurements, Twitter researchers say algorithmic decisionmaking can take choice away from users and have far-reaching impact, particularly for marginalized groups of people.  In the newly released study, Twitter researchers said they did not find evidence that the photo cropping algorithm favors women’s bodies over their faces. To determine this, they fed the algorithm 100 randomly chosen images of people identified as women, and found that only three centered bodies over faces. Researchers suggest this is due to the presence of a badge or jersey numbers on people’s chests. To conduct the study, researchers used photos from the WikiCeleb dataset; identity traits of people in the photos were taken from Wikidata. The Twitter paper acknowledges that by limiting the analysis to Black or white or male and female comparisons, it can exclude people who identify as nonbinary or mixed race. Researchers said they had hoped to use the Gender Shades dataset created to assess the performance of facial recognition systems based on skin tone, but licensing issues arose. Twitter published the study on the preprint repository arXiv. A Twitter spokesperson said it had been submitted to a research conference to be held in October.  Twitter research scientists suggest that the racial bias found in the analysis may be a result of the fact that many images in the WikiCeleb database have dark backgrounds and the saliency algorithm is drawn to the higher contrast of photos showing people with light skin against a dark background. They also suggest that dark eye color on light skin played a role in saliency algorithms favoring people with light skin. Coauthors of the paper come from Twitter’s ML Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability (META) Team, which Twitter launched last month. Rumman Chowdhury, founder of algorithm auditing startup Parity and a former adviser to tech companies and governments, directs the team. In a blog post last month, Twitter said it created the team to take responsibility for Twitter’s use of algorithms, provide transparency into internal decisionmaking about AI that impacts hundreds of millions of people, and hold the company accountable. Some questions remain about how the META team will operate, such as who makes the final call about whether Twitter uses certain kinds of AI. The Twitter spokesperson said cross-functional teams decide what actions are taken on algorithms, but did not address the question of who has final authority to decide when a form of AI is considered too unfair for use. In the coming months, META plans to assess how the Twitter home page recommendation algorithms treat certain racial groups and how Twitter’s AI treats people based on political ideologies. The creation of the META team came amid questions about the independence and viability of ethical AI teams in corporate environments. In a move that has since led AI groups to turn down funding and thousands of Googlers to revolt, Google and former Ethical AI team lead Timnit Gebru parted ways in December 2020. In an interview shortly after, Chowdhury said the episode has consequences for responsible AI and the entire AI industry. As Chowdhury pointed out earlier this year, there are many ways to define an algorithm audit. What’s not included in Twitter’s saliency research: analysis of data used to train Twitter’s saliency algorithm, or more detailed information about the analysis Twitter carried out before the saliency algorithm came into use. When asked how the Twitter saliency controversy changed company policy, a company spokesperson said that the company conducts risk assessments around privacy and security, and that the META team is creating fairness metrics for the company’s model experimentation platform and standards for the ethical review of algorithms.

That's Google's strategy for the ailing smartwatch platform it launched back in 2014. To better compete with the  likes of Apple, Google has a new three-pronged plan to invigorate Wear OS, and it involves partnerships with two brands it previously competed against in the wearable category: Samsung and Fitbit.  First, Wear OS will launch later this year as a unified platform co-developed with Samsung, merging select features from the Tizen operating system the Korean company uses for its Galaxy smartwatches. That means future Samsung watches will run Wear instead of Tizen. Second, Google will add more of its own apps to the Wear platform and will update its existing apps to give them more robust capabilities. Finally, Wear's health and fitness features have been rebuilt from the ground up with input from Samsung and Fitbit, respectively, and Fitbit Wear smartwatches are on the way. (Google completed its acquisition of Fitbit earlier this year, so now the Wear team and the Fitbit teams are under the same roof.) The announcement came at Google IO, the company's annual developer conference. The event is virtual for the first time ever, joining a spate of other tech conferences that have avoided in-person gatherings for more than a year. Tiles are a carousel you can scroll through, positioned next to the watch face. Now any third-party developer can make one. Originally named Android Wear when it first debuted in 2014, the Wear OS smartwatch platform has been made available by Google for any watch manufacturer to use, similar to the arrangement Google has with smartphone manufacturers who want to use its Android operating system. But unlike Android, where a phonemaker can “skin” an Android phone's software to match its brand, companies using Wear didn't have much control over the look and feel of the OS. There wasn't room to tailor the experience to any specific brand. It's likely why Samsung opted to go its own way and develop its own wearable-device software after testing the waters with just one Android Wear smartwatch. Over the years, Google was slow to introduce new features to Wear OS, and the number of manufacturer partners for the OS dwindled. Samsung, on the other hand, saw success with its Galaxy smartwatches despite the gamble of loading them up with its in-house Tizen OS. However, Tizen has its own weaknesses too—namely, the lack of available apps in Samsung's bespoke app store for Tizen. Wear OS smartwatches may not have been popular, but at least the platform has some desirable apps. That brings us to the new unified software platform that Google developed with Samsung. It's technically a new version of Wear OS, although Google hasn't yet decided on its name. The company has dropped the “OS” and has started calling it “Wear,” though a spokesperson says we'll see more finality on the name later this year. More importantly, this new version offers manufacturers more flexibility with hardware and software, meaning a Wear smartwatch's interface can be made to feel more consistent with a brand's smartphone and provide a more homogenous experience. A Google-made reference user interface is also available for manufacturers that don't want to make any tweaks.  “We think this will be great for the overall ecosystem,” says Björn Kilburn, Google's lead project manager on Wear. “It'll be good for all devicemakers; it'll be good for developers that we bring these two things together.” Gear Team Lauren Goode Lily Hay Newman Google also leveraged Samsung's help in making Wear more battery efficient. Most Wear OS smartwatches have historically lasted only a day or two before needing a recharge. Kilburn couldn't offer specifics about battery life gains, which largely depend on the individual smartwatch, but he says many of the workloads that need to run all the time on the watch, like heart-rate sensing, have now been moved to more power-efficient environments in the hardware. You'll soon be able to track your heart rate all day “without killing the battery,” he says. The platform runs more smoothly too. Kilburn cited up to 30 percent faster performance, with animations and transitions that look more fluid. These tests are based on watches using the “latest chipsets,” but Google did not confirm if that meant it's been testing the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 processors that launched last year. Samsung uses its own Exynos processors in its Galaxy smartwatches, so if Wear is optimized for these chips, it might mean more diversity in the smartwatch chipset market (and a potential new revenue stream for Samsung), as the bulk of Wear OS smartwatches are powered by Qualcomm. Some features from Tizen OS are going to be directly ported over to Wear as well, such as Samsung's watch face designer tool. It will be a part of Wear later this year, and many existing watch faces will make the jump with it. That also means Samsung will no longer make Tizen-powered smartwatches. Its future Galaxy smartwatches will run Wear, and the company says it will continue offering familiar experiences, such as the popular rotating bezel that lets a user navigate the software interface without touching the screen. The biggest benefit for Samsung? App support. By nixing Tizen, Kilburn says developers don't need to build apps for as many platforms and can largely focus on Wear and Apple's WatchOS, just like how developers currently build mobile apps for Android and iOS. Thanks to some changes Google has made in its development tools, software-makers should now find it easier and faster to build Wear apps. Kilburn says there will be a lot “more investment and innovation coming to consumers in the form of apps.”  Jisun Park, corporate vice president and head of mobile platform and solutions at Samsung Research America, echoed that sentiment in an email. “Further collaboration with Google also allows us to expand our ecosystem for developers and partners so that they can take the wearable experience to even greater heights,” Park wrote. As for existing Galaxy smartwatches, Samsung says it's committed to providing Galaxy Store support and three years of software updates since the product's launch. Your existing health data can be exported to newer watches, but more details will come at a later date. The greater degree of customization in Wear now afforded to manufacturers does come with a price: the responsibility of delivering software updates. It means new features from Google for the platform may not be available to all Wear smartwatches immediately, similar to how new Android features may or may not roll out to older Android phones. Fragmentation has been a major problem with Android as manufacturers have neglected to issue updates, or have been slow to get around to them. A selection of new designs of some apps in the new version of Wear. This shows offline listening in the YouTube Music app, the Recents menu to see recently opened apps, turn-by-turn navigation in Google Maps, and a Tile from the Calm meditation app. The Apple Watch comes with a host of Apple-made apps, each of which offers similar functionality to its respective iPhone app. That's not the case with Google's Wear platform, and it's a shortcoming the company is trying to fix. Kilburn says the team is rebuilding Google's apps in Wear with updated guidelines from Material design, the company's software design language that ensures apps look and behave in a way that's consistent. This strategy will bring new features to the next generation of Wear smartwatches that more closely match the features found in the respective apps on an Android phone. Google Maps, for example, will offer turn-by-turn navigation in a new user interface that will also work even if your phone is not with you. YouTube Music will finally debut on the platform and will include offline listening (Google says Spotify will also add offline listening). Google Pay support on Wear is expanding to 26 new countries, bringing the total to 37, and will feature a redesign. Many of these changes will arrive later this year alongside the launch of the new Wear, but some updates—like a redesigned Google Assistant—will come in early 2022.   Wear also has some new software navigation tricks. A double press of a button will now instantly switch to a previously open app, and a new Recents menu lets you quickly hop back into recently used apps. Wear's Tiles, which are widgets that sit in a carousel next to the watch face and offer the type of information that can be soaked up with just a glance (like the weather or your next calendar event), are also getting an upgrade: Any third-party developer can now make one.  Double tapping a button on a Wear watch will now take you to the previous app. Another big reason Google lags behind the smartwatch competition is its lackluster health and fitness portfolio. In recent years, Apple has added electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurements into its watches, and rumors suggest blood glucose monitoring will be the next new health feature in the upcoming Series 7 smartwatch. But Google now owns Fitbit, and it's putting the wearable company's prowess in this area to use. Your next Google-powered smartwatch will come with many of the same features found on Fitbit devices right now, such as health tracking and workout progress, as well as those on-wrist celebrations that provide extra motivation. Fitbit will also produce premium smartwatches running Wear in the future. However, features like ECG and SpO2 aren't baked into Wear natively. “Any of those more specialized functionalities like the ECG will be up to the manufacturer,"" Kilburn says. ""We've enabled them to bring that kind of innovation to the marketplace, so it would be up to the specific device launch.” Both Samsung and Fitbit offer SpO2 and ECG tracking on existing watches and trackers, so it's likely (though not confirmed) that those functions will still be present when their respective Wear watches debut later.  Kilburn also says Google has also worked with Fitbit (and Samsung) to rebuild the underlying health and fitness framework in Wear to make activity tracking more accurate, and to make it easier for developers to gather and use the tracking data. ""In the past, they'd have to go all over the operating system to collect the different pieces of data, but we're bringing them all into one framework they'll be able to use.”  Since Fitbit's app will also land on Wear, future Wear smartwatch owners can choose whether to use Fitbit's app or Google Fit to track fitness data. Kilburn couldn't comment on future plans, but says anyone who chooses a Fitbit Wear smartwatch will “continue to have a great experience” with Fitbit. As for future updates to Wear, Kilburn didn't say if Google will follow a yearly cycle of updates like it does with Android, or how Apple debuts a new watchOS version every year. Instead, expect a more frequent cadence of updates.  It should be noted that while Google announced that it closed its Fitbit acquisition in January following approval from the European Union's antitrust commission—with conditions that Google cannot use the health data of Fitbit users for advertising and has to keep Fitbit and Google data separate—it doesn't mean the US Department of Justice has automatically signed off on it. A Google spokesperson says it complied with the department's review and the ""agreed upon waiting period expired without their objection,” but the DOJ's review is still ongoing, and it has enforcement tools it can utilize if it finds the acquisition harms competition.  Nevertheless, even though it's been seven years since Google launched its smartwatch platform, the company doesn't have much to show for it. As of the fourth quarter of 2020, Wear OS counts for a measly 2.7 percent of the market, according to analysis firm Counterpoint Research. Apple saw a 19 percent growth in global smartwatch sales in the same period and now commands 40 percent of the market share. Samsung jumped to 10 percent market share, and Fitbit was stagnant at 7 percent. Google now owns that 7 percent, but it still needs Samsung to grow the Wear platform. “Apple obviously dominates, but Samsung is the clear number two player,” says Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Research. “They have brand recognition. They sell by far the most connected devices, which is kind of the trend also—cellular connectivity. By having a modem in it, you can have a standalone device and don't need your companion smartphone.""   Fieldhack thinks there's a good chance that bringing Samsung, Fitbit, and even fashion brands such as Fossil under the Wear family will spur greater competition and renew developer interest in the platform. “Like smartphones and tablets, as you get higher volumes, costs will go down and you'll get developers behind it more, so the bigger numbers will definitely help Wear OS.”   With Samsung and Fitbit set to debut new smartwatches, and rumors of Google making its own Pixel smartwatch, Wear may finally be able to carve out a space in the market as a worthwhile competitor. “We really believe the smartwatch is a key step in the next evolution in mobile computing,"" Kilburn says.

100," https://www.wsj.com/articles/youll-soon-be-able-to-use-your-apple-watch-without-touching-the-screen-11621624080 Later this year,










            Apple Inc.


      will introduce features that allow users to control an iPad with their eyes, and its smartwatch with gestures like a pinch or a fist clench. The company announced the moves this week as part of Global Accessibility Awareness Day on May 20, an event established in 2011. Other big tech players revealed initiatives and commitments of their own, from automatic podcast transcriptions by










            Spotify Technology S.A.


      to the updated design of a specific virtual block in










            Microsoft Corp.’s


      “Minecraft” to make it more visible to colorblind players. “Companies’ interest in accessibility has definitely grown since 2011,” said









      
      Joe Devon,



      a co-founder of the digital agency Diamond as well as Global Accessibility Awareness Day, also known as GAAD. “Part of the reason is that there is a big movement toward equity and inclusion, and if you’re excluding people with disabilities, you can’t really be inclusive.” AssistiveTouch, Apple’s hand-movement control feature for its smartwatch, was designed to let those with upper-body limb differences use the Apple Watch without having to touch the display or controls, the company said. But once it launches, all users will be able to switch it on, regardless of whether they identify as disabled, a company spokesman said. Later this year, the operating system of the iPad will support third-party eye-tracking devices, making it possible for people to control the tablet using just their eyes, Apple said.  It also plans to introduce “background sounds,” including ocean and rain effects, that iPhone users can play as they use other apps to help minimize distractions and stay calm. The company said it developed the feature in support of people who are neurodiverse. Neurodiversity relates to conditions that affect cognitive functions, like autism and dyslexia. Another new service, available in the U.S., the U.K. and France starting this week, offers sign-language interpreters for deaf and hard-of-hearing people who contact Apple’s customer-service centers. Spotify, for its part, also redesigned some buttons on its mobile app to make them easier for low-vision and visually impaired people to spot, and a new interface design for users who choose to increase the font size on Apple’s mobile operating system. Microsoft’s other moves included a new Accessibility Insider League that lets any Xbox player who identifies as a person with a disability offer accessibility feedback directly to company engineers and game developers.  Get weekly insights into the ways companies optimize data, technology and design to drive success with their customers and employees.   Some accessibility advocates called the breadth of the updates appreciated, but not surprising. Global technology companies have invested heavily in making their products more usable to more people over the past decade, said









      
      Jonathan Hassell,



      founder and chief executive officer of Hassell Inclusion, an accessibility consulting firm based in the U.K.  “The big guys tend to do the right thing,” said Dr. Hassell. “The thing that now needs to be done is for everybody to follow their lead.” Many smaller and medium-size organizations are also dedicated to delivering accessible products and services, according to









      
      Emma Goddard,



      inclusive design and accessibility lead at Deloitte Digital. But the duo behind GAAD believe more will do so if the tools commonly used to build websites and applications go as far as possible to guarantee accessible products. Mr. Devon and his GAAD co-founder,









      
      Jennison Asuncion,



      for the last year have been encouraging organizations to take the “GAAD Pledge,” a commitment to make accessibility as central to product design as privacy and security. Two of the first to sign on are Ember.js and










            Facebook Inc.’s


      React Native, open-source frameworks that other firms use to build digital products. Others are making moves on their own.










            Wix.com Ltd.


      , a company that provides cloud-based web-development services, last month introduced a feature called the Accessibility Wizard that scans users’ sites to find features that could present problems for people with disabilities and impairments. And










            International Business Machines Corp.


      this week rolled out an update to its own Accessibility Checker tool to coincide with GAAD 2021. Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com

Not on the agenda, to the frustration of some gathered on the Zoom call, was the company’s recent deal with former Vice President Mike Pence for a memoir of his life in politics and the Trump administration. Publishing the book, some staffers said at the session, would be a betrayal of the company’s promises to oppose bigotry and make minority employees feel safe. A petition soon followed, signed by more than 200 staff members, or 14% of the staff, plus about 3,500 outside supporters, including Simon & Schuster authors. It demanded that the company scrap the Pence memoir, part of a two-book deal, and refrain from making any deals with members of the Trump administration. It said Mr. Pence advocated for policies that were racist, sexist and discriminatory, and that publishing the book would be “legitimizing bigotry.” That’s when Jonathan Karp, the book publisher’s chief executive, pushed back. Mr. Karp knew he could face dissatisfaction from the staff over the company’s interest in publishing conservative and Republican authors. He had already taken a public stand against one, a book by Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley. "
102,"MOSCOW—Elon Musk raised the prospect of Russian-made  Tesla Inc.  cars, saying the company was considering opening a factory in the country as it looks to expand its production facilities globally. In a 45-minute appearance via video link at a Kremlin-supported educational forum, Mr. Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, said the company was looking at opening production facilities outside of the U.S. and China where it already has sites. “I think we are close to establishing a Tesla presence in Russia, that would be great,” Mr. Musk said Friday, adding that he was also looking at expanding to the former Soviet nation of Kazakhstan, and other neighboring states. “Over time, we will look to have factories in other parts of the world,” he said. Mr. Musk was speaking at a festival for students that attracts science and tech entrepreneurs, and touched on everything from Mars exploration to religion and the future of humanity. Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak was also scheduled to speak at the forum.

103," Apple Inc.  Chief Executive Tim Cook faced tough questions from the federal judge who will decide whether the iPhone maker operates an improper monopoly, including about the competitiveness of its App Store payment system. Mr. Cook spent about four hours Friday on the witness stand in an Oakland, Calif., court trying to rebut claims by “Fortnite” videogame creator Epic Games Inc. that Apple unfairly prohibits competing app stores on the iPhone and forces in-app purchases for digital payments through its own system that takes as much as a 30% cut. He argued that Apple’s prohibition of rival app stores on the iPhone and its insistence on reviewing all apps sold ensures the security of users. He also pushed back against the Epic lawyer’s attempts to show the company was motivated by profit considerations. As Mr. Cook’s time on the public witness stand neared an end, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers interjected, noting that game developers seemed to be generating a disproportionate amount of money for Apple compared with the technology the iPhone maker was providing in turn. She said Apple’s in-app payment system didn’t face competition and zeroed in on why Apple prohibits developers from alerting users in their apps to cheaper options for in-app purchases outside of Apple’s system—an issue that has arisen several times during the trial.

104," Microsoft Corp.  said it plans to largely retire its Internet Explorer browser, adding to the digital scrap heap a product once at the center of one of the tech industry’s biggest battles. The software giant on Wednesday said its Internet Explorer 11 desktop application, the current version, will no longer be supported starting June 15 of next year for certain versions of the company’s Windows software. Microsoft’s browser push now is centered on Edge, which it launched in 2015, and shares underlying technology with Chrome.  Internet Explorer has faded gradually from prominence as rival browsers such as Chrome from  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google unit and Safari from  Apple Inc.  have won audiences. Internet Explorer had less than 2% of the global browser market for desktop computers in April, according to web analytics firm Statcounter. Chrome had more than 65% of that market, ahead of Safari’s roughly 10%. Microsoft Edge had 8%, according to the data. Internet Explorer joins other big names from the early days of the internet era to transition from digital reality to corporate history after being overtaken by others. AOL Instant Messenger was retired in 2017 after users flocked to platforms such as  Facebook Inc.’s  WhatsApp. Two years later, Tumblr, the microblogging site turned social-media network, was sold for a pittance after being overtaken by Facebook and others.  BlackBerry Ltd. , the company that popularized mobile email and whose devices became a must have for many in business, stopped selling its own devices after Apple’s success with the iPhone and other smartphones caught on. It still provides security software for phones and other devices. More than two decades ago, Internet Explorer was riding high—perhaps too high to some. It featured prominently in the browser battle of roughly 20 years ago and in the U.S. government’s antitrust battle against Microsoft. A federal judge ruled that Microsoft maintained its monopoly in operating-systems software by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the web-browser market by unlawfully tying its Internet Explorer browser to its Windows operating-system software. The practice caused the use of Netscape Navigator, once a dominant browser, “to drop substantially” from 1995 to 1998, the judge wrote. Microsoft in 2001 reached a settlement with the Justice Department over its allegations, without admitting wrongdoing. WSJ Membership Customer Service Tools & Features Ads More Dow Jones Products"
105,"Enter News, Quotes, Companies or Videos  https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-new-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-the-best-m1-device-for-you-11621429204 The gap between the Mac and the iPad is the tightest it has ever been. The iPad Pro is now powered by the same M1 chip as the MacBook Pro, while the latest MacBooks can run many iOS apps. Wondering which you should get? For most people, it’s now a worthy question. You’re not a creative professional and don’t necessarily need the iPad’s digital drawing capabilities. But you do like using a touch screen. You rely primarily on web apps, and daily tasks include managing email, composing documents, attending remote meetings—and occasionally bingeing a few episodes before bed. You’re not firmly in Camp iPad or Camp Mac—both are suitable for your computing needs. Sound familiar? You’re in the right place. For this showdown, I’m comparing the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro ($1,099 and up), and the M1 MacBook Air ($999 and up). It might seem odd, pitting the high end of one device against the entry level of the other. But they have similar screen sizes and prices, and with each year, they gain more of the other’s features: The M1 chip nixed the MacBook Air’s biggest pain points, the loud fan and lap-searing heat. Meanwhile, the new big iPad Pro has a screen that’s brighter than any Mac’s."

      will be a smaller, less-indebted company devoted to selling cellphone plans and broadband internet access. In other words, customers and investors will see an AT&T much like the one that existed before its foray into streaming video and satellite TV. But its rivals haven’t been sitting still. “AT&T has a lot of catching up to do,” said









      
      Craig Moffett,



      a longtime telecom analyst at industry research firm MoffettNathanson LLC. “They’re almost certain to be a third player in a three-horse race.” Mr. Moffett said company leaders made the right decision by refocusing their attention on AT&T’s core strengths, though the business will face challenges getting an edge over rivals. But they must still contend with business units facing high costs and shrinking revenue. An AT&T spokesman disagreed, saying the company’s wireless spectrum position “has never been stronger” and still has slack capacity to serve more data to wireless customers. The company told investors it expects to increase its overall revenue and adjusted per-share earnings in the long run. AT&T shares fell 5.8% Tuesday, after slipping nearly 3% on Monday in the wake of the deal announced with










            Discovery Inc.

        DISCB 1.71%


      to combine their media assets into a new, publicly traded company.










        


      The stock has gained about 3% so far this year, while the S&P 500 climbed 10%. The deal earned praise from former SBC Communications Inc. boss









      
      Ed Whitacre,



      who stitched together the landline and wireless assets that formed the modern AT&T before his retirement in 2007.









      
      Randall Stephenson,



      who as CEO from 2007 to 2020 led AT&T’s attack on the entertainment business, wasn’t immediately available for comment. “I’m happy to see us move back into a different type of company,” Mr. Whitacre said in an interview. “The wireless, the broadband—the businesses that we’re used to.…It’s a very wise move for AT&T.” AT&T won’t own an equity stake in the newly formed media company with Discovery, though its shareholders will get a 71% share of the new business.  AT&T will receive about $43 billion through cash, debt securities and other debt shifted to WarnerMedia. The smaller telecom company will mean less cash returned to investors. AT&T predicted it will pay out about $8 billion to $8.6 billion of its cash flow as dividends, down from roughly $15 billion paid last year. AT&T declined to quantify the size of its per-share dividend after the Discovery deal closes. The new media business formed with Discovery is expected to prioritize stock-price growth over dividends. AT&T is still the country’s No. 3 wireless carrier after falling behind a newly enlarged










            T-Mobile US Inc.


      in 2020. It serves more than 83 million cellphone customers and many more Wi-Fi hot spots, connected cars and other mobile devices. The company also connects 14 million residential internet users through its network of fiber-optic cables and copper wires, the latter a legacy of its Ma Bell heritage. Wireless-industry analysts say timing will be especially important as telecom operators catch the next wave of mobile technology called 5G. The fifth-generation specifications allow cellphone carriers to serve many more devices in a cost-effective way, opening up a broad market of vehicles, industrial machines and corporate campuses to wireless service. AT&T had an early advantage in 2007 when its wireless service, then called Cingular, secured exclusive U.S. rights to carry










            Apple Inc.’s


      new iPhone. The coup drew millions of subscribers to its network and helped fuel AT&T’s steadily growing dividend. The company later lost ground to










            Verizon Communications Inc.,


      the country’s largest wireless carrier in terms of subscribers. Verizon invested heavily in its 4G network over the past decade, allowing it to advertise a superior network for streaming videos and other data-heavy services that thrived on the next-generation network’s fast speeds. Over the past five years through Tuesday, AT&T has generated total shareholder returns, a measure of share-price changes and dividend income, of 3%, compared with more than 232% for










            T-Mobile,


      42% for Verizon and 122% for the S&P 500, according to FactSet. Some Wall Street analysts consider T-Mobile in the best spot to capitalize on 5G technology hitting the market this year. The Bellevue, Wash., company’s 2020 merger with former rival Sprint Corp. gave it a cache of wireless spectrum that supports the ultrafast mobile service.  To catch up, Verizon and AT&T spent $45.5 billion and $23.4 billion, respectively, to secure “C-band” spectrum licenses from the Federal Communications Commission. The companies will spend several billion more dollars to compensate satellite operators shifting their operations from those valuable frequencies. T-Mobile spent $9.3 billion on the licenses, which will add to a cache of similar assets it already bought from Sprint. AT&T says it is still investing in its future. Annual capital spending will rise to $24 billion because of the Discovery deal, up from a projected $22 billion in 2021 after accounting for certain adjustments for equipment financing and reimbursements from its FirstNet public-safety network. The Dallas company projected its ramped-up spending will allow it to reach 200 million people with C-band 5G service by the end of 2023, up from its previous 100 million-person target. The company also said it would broaden its network of fiber-optic cables to cover 30 million locations.

107,"One million years ago, when the internet went “Pshhhkkkkkkrrrr…kakingkakingkaking…ding…ding…ding” and this “World Wide Web” thing was only accessible from a dark corner of your house, Apple released the iMac. (“I” is for internet!) Available in bright colors with a matching keyboard and mouse, the iMac wasn’t a boring, intimidating beige PC; it was the friendly, fun home computer. Today, the internet is in our smartphones, tablets, laptops, watches, speakers and TVs, not to mention refrigerators, security cameras and toilets, but Apple Inc. has a new…iMac? Like its similarly priced two-decade-old ancestor, Apple’s 2021 iMac is also available in bright colors and with matching keyboard and mouse. The new version is far more evolved—a third of the weight, 24 times the pixels and at least 50 times the storage space—but the mission feels the same: Entice you to go out of your way to use a thing called a desktop computer. The new iMac, which starts at $1,299 and arrives this Friday, does so by being more iPhone or iPad than any old-school Macintosh. It has a beautiful Retina display and a fingerprint sensor in its keyboard. In some lighting, the webcam is better than the front-facing iPad and iPhone selfie cameras. With a new Apple M1 chip inside, the iMac wakes in a split second—and even runs a handful of iOS apps. WSJ Membership Customer Service Tools & Features Ads More Dow Jones Products"
108,"Parler LLC on Monday named prominent U.K. conservative George Farmer as its new chief executive and said that its social network has returned to Apple Inc.’s App Store, the company’s latest steps to rebuild its business months after the U.S. Capitol riot. Mr. Farmer is succeeding interim chief Mark Meckler, who is leaving the company. Mr. Farmer joined Parler in March as operating chief and previously worked in financial services for a decade, the company said. He is married to Candace Owens, a conservative author and commentator known for being a loyal supporter of former President Donald Trump. In 2019, Mr. Farmer was an active financial supporter and candidate for the U.K.’s Brexit Party, according to Parler. The company didn’t disclose the reason behind the executive change. “For the past two months I have worked with an incredible team of people, under the leadership of Mark Meckler, to bring Parler back online and return to Apple’s App Store after we had been unfairly maligned by the media and its allies in Big Tech and Congress,” Mr. Farmer said in a statement.

109," Apple Inc.  gets its turn this week to mount a courtroom defense against Epic Games Inc.’s antitrust claims, preparing to bring in its most powerful spokesman: Tim Cook. Mr. Cook, a guarded chief executive who is used to carefully orchestrated public appearances, is set to testify in a trial that, regardless of the verdict, could prove to be one of the most consequential for the iPhone maker as it faces accusations it denies of abusing its market power. Approaching the 10th anniversary of taking over as chief executive, Mr. Cook is no stranger to high-profile, make-or-break moments for Apple. A polished public speaker, he has twice testified before Congress but never appeared on a witness stand in a trial where his words could sway a judge for or against the company. His testimony is likely to be the most detailed public discussion he will give on a subject that is likely to loom over Apple for years to come. Mr. Cook has been preparing for the trial, according to a person familiar with his effort. That has included hours of practice rounds from former prosecutors chosen by his legal team to simulate the witness stand. He is expected to seek to bolster Apple’s argument that it isn’t a monopoly in a case that threatens to unravel its control over the App Store, a key part of Apple’s services business that generated almost $54 billion last year.
