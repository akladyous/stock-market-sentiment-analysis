company,1623110079,Apple's new 'private relay' feature will not be available in China ,68011194,,AAPL,Reuters,"Apple Inc on Monday said a new ""private relay"" feature designed to obscure a user's web browsing behavior from internet service providers and advertisers will not be available in China for regulatory reasons.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b5c3de85e4357a46bdffb9c0e27ef8c7fe4ff1a4989f5f108a936ec7fb1d76c4,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Stephen Nellis, Paresh Dave 3 Min Read (Reuters) -Apple Inc on Monday said a new “private relay” feature designed to obscure a user’s web browsing behavior from internet service providers and advertisers will not be available in China for regulatory reasons. The feature was one of a number of privacy protections Apple announced at its annual software developer conference on Monday, the latest in a years-long effort by the company to cut down on the tracking of its users by advertisers and other third parties. Apple’s decision to withhold the feature in China is the latest in a string of compromises the company has made on privacy in a country that accounts for nearly 15% of its revenue. In 2018, Apple moved the digital keys used to lock Chinese users’ iCloud data, allowing authorities to work through domestic courts to gain access to the information. China’s ruling Communist Party maintains a vast surveillance system to keep a close eye on how citizens use the country’s heavily controlled internet. Under President Xi Jinping, the space for dissent in China has narrowed, while censorship has expanded. Apple’s “private relay” feature first sends web traffic to a server maintained by Apple, where it is stripped of a piece of information called an IP address. From there, Apple sends the traffic to a second server maintained by a third-party operator who assigns the user a temporary IP address and sends the traffic onward to its destination website. The use of an outside party in the second hop of the relay system is intentional, Apple said, to prevent even Apple from knowing both the user’s identity and what website the user is visiting. Apple said it also will not offer “private relay” in Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda and the Philippines. Apple has not yet disclosed which outside partners it will use in the system but said it plans to name them in the future. The feature likely will not become available to the public until later this year. IP addresses can be used to track users in a variety of ways, including as a key ingredient in “fingerprinting,” a practice in which advertisers string together disparate data to deduce a user’s identity. Both Apple and Alphabet Inc’s Google prohibit this. Combined with Apple’s previous steps, the “private relay” feature “will effectively render IP addresses useless as a fingerprinting mechanism,” Charles Farina, head of innovation at digital marketing firm Adswerve, told Reuters. It will also prevent advertisers from using IP addresses to pinpoint a person’s location, he said.

Apple revealed a new service called iCloud+ at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday. One of the features included in that is ""Private Relay."" When users browse the internet using Safari, their data will be sent through two separate servers in order to mask the user's identity and what sites they are visiting. As a result, even Apple or the user's network provider cannot see that data. It's a little like a virtual private network (VPN) where users can route their internet traffic through a server located somewhere else in the world to mask their browsing activity. China so-called Great Firewall effectively allows authorities to block websites from being accessed within China including Google and Facebook. VPNs are often used to get around China's strict internet controls. An Apple spokesperson told CNBC that Private Relay will not work in China and some other countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Belarus and Uganda. Apple said it could not offer the feature in these countries due to local laws. Using unauthorized VPNs to access blocked websites is illegal in China. While Apple's Private Relay is not technically a VPN, it acts in a similar way. In 2017, the U.S. technology giant removed a number of VPN services from its China App Store to comply with local regulations. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Brooks Kraft/Apple Inc./Handout via REUTERS   Apple Inc (AAPL.O), facing accusations from rivals that it has too much control over its App Store, on Monday outlined plans to increase user privacy and keep consumer data out of other companies’ hands, laying out features including expanded video conferencing and storing virtual government IDs on iPhones. The changes came at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference for software developers, some of whom have started to complain about Apple's grip over which apps can appear on its devices, as well as its 15% to 30% commissions on digital sales. Many of the new features allow users to safeguard data, trusting the information to the Apple brand. Users will be able to scan ID cards in participating U.S. states, and the cards will be encrypted in a user's digital wallet, along with credit cards and transit cards in some U.S. cities. It is working with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration to accept the digital IDs at airports. In many cases, Apple itself cannot see all the information. The company has updated the paid version of its iCloud storage service to include a service that obscures a user's Web-browsing habits, even from Apple. Another new iCloud feature will let users hide their real email address, which has become increasingly used as an identifier for digital marketers to track users. Apple said iCloud pricing will not change with the new features. Apple also tweaked some of its apps and services in ways that could intensify its rivalries with Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) and Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Teams, both of which gained prominence during the pandemic. It updated its FaceTime video chat app to allow scheduling calls with multiple attendees and making the software compatible with Android and Windows devices. Apple also introduced what it calls in-app events, a way for developers to host live events within apps and have those events featured in real time in the App Store. Video game developers, for example, could host live tournaments and market those on the App Store, which Apple's current systems are not built to handle. The move could intensify competition with Facebook Inc (FB.O), which on Monday said it was planning to launch an online events business that would be free until 2023 and thereafter will charge commissions lower than Apple’s 30% fees for the App Store.  Several of the other features Apple introduced Monday, such as the ability to snap a photo of a sign and use artificial intelligence to pluck out the written text, have been present on the rival Android operating system for several years. The rest of Apple's conference is dedicated to technical sessions for developers, some of whom have bristled at its controls and fees. Those issues have come under regulatory scrutiny and are at the heart of an antitrust lawsuit brought by “Fortnite” creator Epic Games, in which a federal judge is considering how to rule.  Apple has said its App Store practices increase the market for mobile software by creating an environment for paid apps that consumers trust, and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and his team did not address frayed developer relations during the presentation. Not all developers have negative sentiments, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive at Creative Strategies, who has been surveying Apple developers and found more than 90% have no plans to stop making apps for Apple devices. However, some complaints are widespread, with more than half of developers saying fees should be capped at 10%, and many wanting more clarity around reasons for rejecting apps from the App Store and how to resolve such issues, Bajarin said.

Here are the main takeaways from the conference: FACETIME COMES TO ANDROID, WINDOWS Apple's video and audio chat app, FaceTime, adds the ability to schedule calls with multiple attendees and making the software compatible with Android and Windows devices. Unlike Zoom (ZM.O), Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Teams and other video conferencing services, FaceTime was limited to Apple devices. The move comes as video conferencing services have seen a meteoric rise, with users shifting to remote work and online learning during the pandemic. The new SharePlay feature will enable real-time interaction between people while on FaceTime calls, including co-watching videos, streaming shows and films, as well as listening to music and screen sharing. SharePlay will keep everyone's playback in sync and is set to work with Disney+ (DIS.N), ESPN+, HBO Max (T.N), Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount+ (VIAC.O), Pluto TV, TikTok, Twitch (AMZN.O). (https://apple.co/3cp3KHz) DEVELOPERS GET BOOST WITH IN-APP EVENTS Apple has offered developers a way to host live events within apps, calling the feature in-app events. User can participate in events such as live competitions on a gaming app in the App Store through personalized recommendations, editorial selections, search results and app product pages. The move could intensify competition with Facebook, which on Monday said it was planning to launch an online events business that would be free until 2023 and thereafter will charge commissions lower than Apple's 30%.  read more  IPHONES TO REPLACE ID CARDS The iPhone maker is also looking to offer the ability of storing digitized versions of state-issued identification cards on its smartphones. It is working with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration for the acceptance of digital IDs at airports, one of several updates to the software that runs on its devices. UPS PRIVACY FEATURES Apple introduced App privacy reports as a new way for users to track how often third-party apps use data and where they send it. Its email apps will be updated to block senders using trackers that detect when an email is opened. Additionally, Siri requests will now be processed entirely on iPhones by default, without being routed to an Apple server to respond to requests, making the service faster and more secure.  ICLOUD BECOMES ICLOUD+ Apple overhauled its storage service subscription, iCloud+. New features include ""private relay"" that hides a user's identity and browsing data from both Apple and advertisers on its web browser, Safari. Another feature lets users hide their email addresses when filling out online forms, helping them control who can contact them. MACS CAN BE USED TO CONTROL OTHER APPLE DEVICES Apple added a feature that would let users control several devices at once, including moving the cursor and dragging objects across screens, thus giving them control over other Apple devices from Mac computers and laptops. It announced other software improvements to make working across its devices easier. These features, like many other flagship Apple features, will not work with third party devices.

company,1623091979,"Apple is turning privacy into a business advantage, not just a marketing slogan",68005525,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106893386-1623091681148Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-2-46-31-PM-png?v=1623091743,AAPL,CNBC,"Privacy was mentioned as part of nearly every new feature Apple announced on Monday, and got stage time of its own. ",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=51f9e806092681a03cecdb9a86670d16c0f2a30fd4e11aa7991bbfb91956152c," In this article Apple unveiled new versions of its operating systems on Monday which showed that the company's focus on privacy has taken a new turn. It's not just a corporate ideal or a marketing point anymore. It's now a major initiative across Apple distinguishing its products from Android and Windows competition. Apple has positioned itself as the most privacy-sensitive big technology company since Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote an open letter on the topic in 2014. Since then, Apple has introduced new iPhone features that restrict app access to personal data and advertised privacy heavily in television ads. But Monday's announcements showed that Apple's privacy strategy is now part of its products: Privacy was mentioned as part of nearly every new feature, and got stage time of its own. Privacy-focused features and apps announced by Apple on Monday for forthcoming operating systems iOS 15 or MacOS Monterey included: With its focus on privacy, Apple is leaning on one of its core strengths. Increasingly, data is being processed on local devices, like a computer or phone, instead of being sent back to big servers to analyze. This is both more private, because the data doesn't live on a server, and potentially faster from an engineering standpoint. Read more: Apple's new privacy feature, designed to mask users' internet browsing, won't be available in China Because Apple designs both the iPhone and processors that offer heavy-duty processing power at low energy usage, it's best poised to offer an alternative vision to Android developer Google which has essentially built its business around internet services. This engineering distinction has resulted in several new apps and features that do significantly more processing on the phone instead of in the cloud, including: Apple's privacy infrastructure also allows it to expand into big new markets like online payments, identity, and health, both from a product and marketing perspective. It can build new products while being sure that it's following best practices for not collecting unnecessary data or violating policies like Europe's strict General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In addition, users may feel more comfortable about features that deal with sensitive data or topics — like finance or health — because they trust Apple and its approach to data. Features introduced by Apple on Monday show how the company is using its user data position to break into these lucrative markets. Cook has said ""privacy is a fundamental human right"" and that the company's policies and his personal stance doesn't have to do with commerce or Apple's products. But being the big technology company that takes data issues seriously could end up being lucrative and allow Apple more freedom to launch new services and products. Facebook, Apple's Silicon Valley neighbor and vocal Apple critic, has increasingly dealt with challenges launching new products because of the company's poor reputation on how it handles user data. Americans also say that privacy is factoring into buying decisions. A Pew study from 2020 said that 52% of Americans decided not to use a product or service because of concerns over data protection.

(Alliance News) - Apple Inc has completed its annual preview of the new features coming to the iPhone and its other devices and services later this year. The biggest update in iOS 15 is coming to FaceTime, which in the wake of the pandemic and the rise of apps such as Microsoft Corp's Teams feature and Zoom Video Communications Inc, is now going to look and feel much more like those platforms. FaceTime users will be able to schedule calls for the first time, and share links to join the virtual gatherings, links which will even enable Android and Windows users to join FaceTime calls via a web browser – another first. The other big change is something Apple is calling Focus. This takes the Do Not Disturb feature and allows users to customise it further, with new Focus themes which block out notifications from friends and family when switched to work mode, or shut out notes from colleagues when a user wants to spend quality time with loved ones. Notifications have also been undated with a new Summary tool, which will group certain, less-pressing alerts together as a collection and can be scheduled to come through when you've got more time to go through them. Elsewhere, the Wallet app is expanding to now support house and hotel room keys, as well as office passes for the first time, so users can tap with their iPhone to enter. Apple Maps has been given a new, more detailed 3D look too, while the iPhone camera is now able to spot and lift text from images. The widgets introduced to the iPhone home screen last year are now coming to iPad, while multitasking tools have been enhanced to give users ways to customise different split-screen set-ups. A Quick Note feature is coming too, meaning users can swipe from the corner of the screen at any time and within any app with an Apple Pencil to launch a new note and quickly scribble down what they need to. Health and wellbeing were again key parts of the Apple Watch software update, with a new Reflect app joining the Breathe feature inside a new Mindfulness app. Reflect will ask users to think of a happy thought or moment of joy for a few seconds and focus on it, as a new alternative to the breathing exercises in the Breathe app. Meanwhile, tai chi and pilates workouts have been added to the Fitness apps, and Portrait photos can now be used as interactive watch faces. On its Mac operating system, Apple also outlined updates. To be called macOS Monterey, the next version of the computer software will include a new tool called Universal Control, which will enable people to use a single mouse and keyboard to control and navigate the screens of up to three different devices. For example, someone editing an image on a MacBook will be able to use the trackpad to move over and take control of their iPad set up next to them, and even an iMac as well if they have one – allowing them to work across the three machines at once. Safari, Apple's web browser, has also been given a redesign, with a more compact, tidier address bar and tabs section and the ability to group tabs into collections for the first time. Apple boss Tim Cook said all the new software would be released to the public in the autumn, likely to coincide with the launch of the next iPhone and other Apple hardware. Apple shares closed largely flat at USD125.90 each in New York on Monday. source: PA Services My Account Resources Client Support Follow Us Facebook Twitter Linkedin You Tube Zacks Moblie App Zacks Research is Reported On:"

(Alliance News) - Stocks in New York ended mixed on Monday as market participants weighed inflation risks and the potential of a minimum corporate tax on high-earning companies. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Bloomberg News that US President Joe Biden should push ahead with his USD4.0 trillion recovery plan for the world's top economy even if it triggers high inflation that leads to interest rate rises. Yellen said any inflation spike in reaction to Biden's huge plan to revitalise the US economy would be transitory and that higher interest rates would actually be positive. Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 126.15 points, or 0.4%, at 34,630.24. The S&P 500 ended down 3.37 points, or 0.1%, at 4,226.52. Nasdaq Composite finished 67.23 points higher, or 0.5%, at 13,881.72. ""Having seen US markets finish last week on the up, we are seeing some modest signs of profit taking after weekend comments from US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying that she welcomed the prospect of higher rates if the economy warranted it,"" said CMC Market s analyst Michael Hewson. On Wall Street, S&P 500 and Nasdaq-listed Biogen closed up 38% after the US Food & Drug Administration approved the drugmaker's aducanumab as the first treatment to attack a likely cause of Alzheimer's disease. It is the only drug that US regulators have said can likely treat the underlying disease, rather than manage symptoms like anxiety and insomnia. The decision, which could impact millions of people and their families, is certain to spark disagreements among physicians, medical researchers and patient groups. It also has far-reaching implications for the standards used to evaluate experimental therapies, including those that show only incremental benefits. Moderna shares closed up 6.6% and hit a fresh record high of USD227.71 after the drugmaker said  it was seeking conditional approval for use of its Covid-19 vaccine on teens in Europe and Canada, in what will assuredly be a boost for inoculation campaigns. Meanwhile, finance ministers from wealthy G7 nations on Saturday endorsed a global minimum corporate tax of at least 15%, rallying behind a US-backed plan targeting tech giants and other multinationals accused of not paying enough. Yellen hailed the ""unprecedented commitment"", saying in a statement that a global minimum tax ""would end the race to the bottom in corporate taxation"". Facebook even got behind the move despite the social media giant facing the prospect of having to pay more tax - while non-governmental organizations said it did not go far enough. European countries had been concerned that this could exclude Amazon, which has lower profit margins than most tech companies - but Yellen said she expected it would be included. Facebook shares closed up 1.9%. Amazon.com fell 0.3%, Apple closed flat, Alphabet A shares rose 0.4% and Microsoft climbed 1.2%. ""For corporates in general, the ramifications of the G7 agreement over the weekend to impose a minimum global corporate tax of 15% remain to be seen. At this stage, the proposal is in its early stages and potentially imposing such a rule for the G20 as a whole could be a demanding process,"" interactive investor's Richard Hunter. In Europe, FTSE 100 in London closed up 0.1%, the DAX 30 in Frankfurt down 0.1% and the CAC 40 in Paris up 0.4%. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.3% in Tokyo. In China, the Shanghai Composite finished up 0.2%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong ended down 0.6%. Sterling was changing hands at USD1.4185 at the New York close on Monday, higher against USD1.4165 at the close on Friday. The euro was priced at USD1.2195, up from USD1.2168. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was quoted at JPY109.23, down from JPY109.52. Brent oil was quoted at USD71.52 a barrel at the New York equity market close Monday, edging lower from USD71.66 late Friday. West Texas Intermediate was priced at USD69.15 a barrel, down from USD69.39. Gold was trading at USD1,899.33 an ounce at the New York market close, up from USD1,891.70. The economic events calendar on Tuesday has Germany industrial production at 0700 BST, eurozone economic growth figures at 1000 BST and US trade data at 1330 BST.

NEW YORK (AP) — Apple kicked off its second annual all-virtual developer conference with a keynote that outlined new updates to its software for iPhones and other devices. The presentation highlighted more privacy options for paid iCloud accounts and a “Find My” service that helps find errant AirPods, but included no major product announcements. The latest renovations in Apple’s $2 trillion empire come at a pivotal time for the Cupertino, California, company. Apple is facing legal and regulatory threats to its control over its App Store, a so-called “walled garden” that produces substantial profits for the company. Apple CEO Tim Cook, Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, and other executives outlined updates to software for Apple's many devices including its MacBooks, iMacs, iPhone, iPad and Watch. Apple’s new MacOS software, dubbed Monterey, supports what Apple calls “universal control,” which lets people use one mouse and keyboard to control an iMac desktop computer, MacBook laptop and iPad at the same time. Forrester analyst Julie Ask said the improvements Apple showed off, like the “universal control,” play to Apple’s strengths in blending its products and services. “The news today was nothing ‘new new,’ like holy cow how did they make that happen,” she said. “But each of us picks up our phone 100 or 200 times a day, and they’re making 100 little moments a day better, more seamless, and easier.” She pointed out Apple's plan to support digital IDs including drivers licenses and state IDs from “participating U.S. states” in its digital wallet, as another example. Apple did not identify which states that will include. “They have an army of people trying to get these deals signed,” she said. “Apple gets a lot of criticism for being so controlling. But they can do things other big brands struggle to do.” A “Live Text” feature in iOS 15 will let you highlight text in photos and copy and paste it or look it up online. It will also integrate Air Pods into its “Find My” service, which helps people find lost or misplaced Apple products. Apple is introducing more privacy features to its paid iCloud plans, including a way to hide your email address, encrypt video, and a “Private Relay” feature of Safari that encrypts data from the web browser similar to a VPN. Paid plan pricing isn’t changing. Users pay for any iCloud storage above the free 5GB storage users get for free. In the U.S., those plans start at $1 a month for 50GB of storage. Apple didn’t announce when iOS 15 will be available, but the company traditionally releases the free updates to all compatible iPhones in September.

The feature, which will roll out this fall, could help Apple keep customers from defecting to competing video chat apps such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams when they need to video chat with friends and colleagues who aren't on an Apple device. Apple isn't launching an Android FaceTime app, though. Instead, it will let you schedule and share FaceTime calls using a unique web link. Once someone receives that link, whether on Windows or Android, they'll be able to jump in and participate in the call. Apple said it's still end-to-end encrypted so it's still private. People who want to join a FaceTime call just need to be running the latest version of Google's Chrome or Microsoft's Edge web browser, according to Apple's website. People will still need an Apple device to start the call, or to partake in some of the new features Apple announced for FaceTime on Monday, such as watching a movie together or listening to music, which may require specific Apple apps depending on what you're trying to do.

While Netflix has become a staple of television service in some 70 million American households, the addition of Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, Peacock, Apple TV+, Paramount+, and Amazon Prime has created a veritable buffet of entertainment choice for consumers. The recent merger announcement of Discovery with Time Warner, bringing together Discovery+ with HBO Max, has further underscored that the future of TV lies in streaming entertainment services. Sports programming has gotten into the game. ESPN, which has been slow out of the gates into streaming, has recently signed renewal deals for substantial amounts of professional sports programming that give it flexibility to air those offerings on the ESPN+ streaming service. In addition, Amazon recently agreed to pay the NFL $10 billion just to air Thursday Night Football on its streaming service over the next ten years. As entertainment and sports programming migrate to the streaming world, the cable and satellite bundles of channels are losing subscribers at an accelerating rate with viewers cutting the cord -- or in the case of younger viewers, never subscribing to cable or satellite to begin with. So, while the streaming wars heat up, and legacy television channels lose both viewing audience and subscribers, no one is really focused on what this means for television news. To understand the impending crisis for television news, one needs to understand the economics of the current television system. Television channels today not only derive advertising revenue from attracting an audience, but crucially important to their economics are the fees paid by cable and satellite operators for carrying those channels. For instance, CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, and Fox News get paid very substantial fees across every cable and satellite household in the United States of which today. Today, that means subscriber fees are paid to news channels covering over 75 million, down from close to 100 million at one point not long ago. The news channels get paid across every single one of those households even though only a small minority of households watch each of those channels. That creates a very substantial revenue base supporting the big TV news franchises -- regardless of how many viewers the channel actually has, it is getting paid across all cable and satellite homes. Similarly, local television stations, which are the backbone of local TV news are paid what are called ""retransmission consent fees"" from cable and satellite operators, which are very substantial payments for the right to carry those stations. Those stations also are paid across all the cable and satellite homes in a given local market, regardless of what percentage of those homes actually watch any given channel. Because of this unique payment system for legacy broadcast and cable channels, many consider this payment system to be the best possible economic model the television industry could have. As we move away from consumers getting a bundle of cable or channels to an environment where consumers take a few streaming services that they pay directly for, the whole concept of collecting money across all homes goes away. Entertainment content is making this transition, even though many industry analysts doubt that all entertainment streaming services will make it. Sports programming is beginning to make this transition as well. But there is a huge question mark about how news will be supported in this new streaming world. Any one news channel transitioning to a live streaming service would have to charge a very substantial fee to each home to make up for the cable and satellite carriage it is losing. News viewers may be the last ones to abandon the pay-TV bundle, but inevitably as the reach of that bundle shrinks, those fees will shrink along with it. Complicating the picture further, there is substantial additional competition for television news, with Roku and Amazon both providing ample streaming news services. They do not have the star power or depth of content of the better-known TV brands, but do provide a reasonable news menu for those who are not political junkies or news channel brand loyalists. TV news began as public service programming that broadcasters had to carry as a condition of getting a license from the FCC. The television news business eventually turned profitable, but it will soon face an existential crisis as to how to remain so. There are some possibilities for preserving the economics of news channels and local news, beyond sending each channel out on its own to try to get sufficient direct-to-consumer streaming revenue from loyal viewers. One possibility is to create a large bundle of national and local news, made available through a single packager. This is what Apple is doing with magazines and newspapers, offering scores of popular magazines and newspapers digitally for a monthly fee at $9.99 with Apple News+, but so far it has been underwhelming in terms of its adoption. And traditional media companies are going to be extremely wary of enhancing Apple's power in the media marketplace as they increasingly compete in streaming entertainment. Another possibility would be to find a more Switzerland-like player to act as a neutral distributor. News channels and stations are all in this predicament together -- if they can't get subscription fees from all cable and satellite households, they'd at least like to get fees from all news households, even those that don't represent loyal viewership of their particular brand. Certain companies may be able to go it alone better than others. Comcast and NBCUniversal have a broad array of assets including CNBC, the leading business news channel; MSNBC, the leading source of progressive-oriented political news; Sky News, the leading international news channel; NBC News Now, a streaming service; news offerings from digital streaming service Peacock; and a multitude of local stations and regional news channels. Providing a separate news bundle to households who otherwise subscribe to Peacock could drive broad uptake of news content while also driving enhanced distribution of the broader entertainment streaming service. Fox is putting a lot of shoulder behind Fox Nation, a subscription news channel intended to satisfy the insatiable appetite among that news audience for right-wing, often extreme commentary. There may be a model here for Fox, but my guess is it is not a sufficient one to make up for the substantial financial decline the Fox News Channel will suffer with significantly diminished cable/satellite subscriber fee support. The center of any democracy is a well-informed citizenry and a robust marketplace of ideas where quality news content can survive and thrive. Right now, there is no obvious answer to saving TV news as pay-TV subscribership declines, but let's not allow quality television news to become collateral damage in the entertainment streaming wars.

 This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210607005649/en/ New tools designed expressly for Apple developers will help create even more engaging app experiences. (Photo: Business Wire) 
“We’re thrilled to provide our developer community with powerful new tools and technologies to help create even more compelling and higher-quality apps, while engaging with their users in all new ways through the App Store,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “With the robust set of tools included in Xcode Cloud, continuing innovation in the Swift programming language, a wide range of new APIs, and even more ways to reach users — Apple’s platforms have never been stronger.”
 
Xcode Cloud
 
Xcode Cloud is a new continuous integration and delivery cloud service designed specifically for Apple developers. Built into Xcode 13, Xcode Cloud offers a fast and simple way for developers and teams of all sizes to build, test, and deliver high-quality apps even more efficiently. Xcode Cloud can automatically build apps in the cloud to free up developers’ Macs for other tasks. Parallel testing in the cloud means developers can test on a simulated version of every current Apple device, then easily deploy a build of the app for internal testing, or deliver to external beta testers through TestFlight® for instant feedback.
 
App Store
 
With more apps and games featuring events like live competitions, movie premieres, live-streamed experiences, and much more, it’s now easier for users to discover these events right on the App Store — in personalized recommendations, editorial selections, search results, and on app product pages. This greatly expands the reach of developers’ events — helping connect them with new users, keep their current users informed, or reconnect them with past users. It’s a whole new way for developers to showcase what’s happening in their apps.
 
A top-requested feature among developers, Apple is introducing new product page tools that offer developers greater flexibility and new ways to connect with users right in the App Store. Custom Product Pages let developers showcase different features of their app for different users, while Product Page Optimization gives developers the ability to test different screenshots, preview videos, and even app icons. With rich, privacy-friendly analytics in App Store Connect, developers can see what their users like most and make the best decisions for their product pages.
 
Apple is introducing updated guidelines that include support for the emerging category of apps that offer creator content experiences. The developer code of conduct expands to help keep the App Store a fair marketplace for developers and users, including updated guidelines around developer identity requirements, ratings and review manipulation, and excessive customer complaints. There are also new avenues for developers to appeal an app rejection on concerns of bias, as well as the option for them to report an app if there is reason to believe an app presents a trust or safety concern, or is in violation of the App Store Review Guidelines.
 
Swift
 
Swift — Apple’s powerful and intuitive programming language — now features built-in concurrency support. This means developers can more easily write code that does work in parallel, which is key to building apps that are responsive to user input, while doing more work in the background. With concurrency in Swift, developers can write fast, modern, safe code with fewer mistakes, and take full advantage of the powerful multicore silicon across Apple’s devices.
 
SwiftUI® has reinvented user interface development by making it easier to develop great-looking apps with as little code as possible. Now SwiftUI takes a huge step forward, helping developers bring better experiences to all their users. This includes enhancements for improving list views, search experiences, in-app accessibility features, multi-column tables, and so much more.
 
Swift Playgrounds® is a great way to learn to code right on a Mac® or iPad®. With Swift Playgrounds 4, coming later this year, users will be able to create the visual design of an app with SwiftUI. App projects can be opened and edited in Swift Playgrounds or in Xcode, and when they’re ready, users can build a real app and submit it directly to the App Store right from their iPad.
 
Augmented Reality
 
Apple has the world’s largest augmented reality platform with over 1 billion AR-enabled devices powered by ARKit®, a framework that allows developers to easily create AR experiences, and RealityKit™, the rendering, animation, audio, and physics engine built from the ground up for AR.
 
RealityKit 2 introduces Object Capture, a simple and powerful API on macOS Monterey™ that enables developers — like Wayfair, Etsy, and more — to create high-quality, photo-realistic 3D models of real-world objects in minutes by taking photos shot on iPhone®, iPad, or DSLR and transforming them into 3D models optimized for AR. These models can be viewed in AR Quick Look or added to AR scenes in Reality Composer™ or Xcode, making it easier than ever to build amazing AR apps. Developers like Maxon and Unity are using Object Capture to unlock entirely new ways of creating 3D content within some of the leading 3D content creation apps, such as Cinema4D and Unity MARS.
 
With new APIs in RealityKit 2, developers can also create more realistic and complex AR experiences with greater visual, audio, and animation control, including custom render passes and dynamic shaders.
 
Graphics and Games
 
New APIs and tools in iOS, iPadOS®, and macOS® will help game developers create the next generation of games and deliver all-new experiences to their users. A new Metal® texture compression tool supports all of the latest formats, as well as optimized formats for Apple silicon, making it easier for developers to bring high-end games to all of Apple’s platforms. Additionally, a new Virtual Game Controller on iPhone and iPad provides an easy method to optimize games that build in Game Controller support.
 
Additional Developer Tools and APIs
 
Apple is providing developers with a range of new tools and APIs that will push their app experience forward and enable them to create entirely new features — all built with privacy at the forefront.
 
— Xcode 13 adds powerful new team development features that are perfect for working with Xcode Cloud, as well as with GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab collaboration features.
 
— With SharePlay™, popular apps like Disney+, ESPN+, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount+, TikTok, and Twitch are building new types of shared experiences for users on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.1
 
— Third-party video-calling apps can take advantage of the latest FaceTime® enhancements, including Voice Isolation, Wide Spectrum Audio, and Portrait mode.
 
— Messaging apps including Slack and WeChat can now share user status in conversations; apps like Uber Eats can have Siri announce incoming messages; and new Notification APIs enable high-priority and communication notifications from apps like Chase Mobile and Zomato to break through Do Not Disturb or a Focus.
 
— New camera APIs allow for better fused images and add the ability to capture high-quality stills and 1080p video in the same session.
 
— Apple Watch® developers like Breakpoint Studio, Pandora, Qardio, and more are now creating new app experiences that offer a deeper level of customization, and are more responsive to their users’ environment.
 
— With TestFlight on the Mac, developers can test in-app purchases and other great Mac app features.
 
— StoreKit™ 2, which ensures in-app purchases are safe and secure for customers, now features new APIs for handling product entitlements and subscriber status, and testing support in both Xcode and the Apple sandbox environment.
 
— Web developers including Grammarly and Honey are now building extensions in Safari that are available across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Developers can even create new, powerful extensions in the Mail app.
 
— Third-party navigation apps can now show a map view in a vehicle’s instrument cluster display, and a new CarPlay® simulator for Mac vastly improves testing efficiency.
 
— Apps can offer the theater-like experience of spatial audio and place sounds all around to bring their content to life. And Physical Audio Spatialization Engine (PHASE) makes it easy for game developers to render true-to-life audio across all of Apple’s platforms.
 
— ShazamKit™ enables developers to integrate audio recognition technology directly from Shazam® into their apps, making it possible not only to match music to Shazam's vast catalog of songs, but also to match any prerecorded audio to custom results developers create.

New watchOS offers greater access with Wallet, more capabilities with the Home app, new workout types, and an updated Breathe app
     CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Apple® today previewed watchOS® 8, with impactful new features that make the world’s most advanced wearable operating system even more essential for users to stay healthy, active, and connected. Updates to the Wallet and Home apps extend Apple Watch® as an increasingly useful tool for convenient access across the car and places users live, work, and visit. A reimagined Breathe app and new Tai Chi and Pilates workout types help users lead a fit and healthy life and support mental well-being, while a new Portraits watch face and enhancements to Messages and the Photos app make staying connected to loved ones even easier.
 This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210607005659/en/ watchOS 8 brings new access, connectivity, and mindfulness features to Apple Watch this fall. (Photo: Business Wire) 
“Apple Watch is the most loved watch in the world, keeping users healthy, active, and connected,” said Kevin Lynch, Apple’s vice president of Technology. “With watchOS 8, we’re bringing more convenient access to places users live, work, and visit with significant updates to Home and Wallet, expanding support for both physical and mental well-being, and enabling richer personal connections with the new Portraits face and updates to Messages.”
 
More Access with Wallet
 
With Apple Watch, it is incredibly convenient to use Apple Pay® and Wallet to make secure, contactless payments in stores or ride transit. With watchOS 8, Wallet brings even more powerful contact-free ways for users to access the places and things they care about seamlessly, safely, and securely.
 
First announced at WWDC in 2020, Ultra Wideband support now arrives for digital car keys on Apple Watch Series 6. Apple Watch wearers can securely unlock their car from a distance and start it from the driver’s seat.1 This fall, users can also add keys for their home, office, and hotel to Wallet, and tap their Apple Watch to unlock.2 Later this year, beginning with participating states in the US, users will be able to add their driver’s license or state ID to Wallet. Select TSA checkpoints will be the first place users can begin using their digital ID.
 
Redesigned Home App
 
The redesigned Home app in watchOS 8 offers more convenient access to accessories and scenes needed in a particular moment, and the ability to control accessories by room. Users with a HomeKit®-enabled camera can view who is at the door directly on their wrist. Apple Watch users can also tap Intercom to quickly broadcast a message throughout the home or to individual rooms via HomePod®, HomePod mini™, or other personal devices.
 
New Workout Types
 
watchOS 8 introduces two new popular workout types that are beneficial for both physical fitness and mindful movement: Tai Chi and Pilates. These new workout types are supported by powerful, validated custom-built heart rate and motion algorithms to provide users with accurate metrics.
 
A New Approach to Mindfulness
 
Now more than ever, people are recognizing the importance of finding small moments in their day to be more mindful. In watchOS 8, the Breathe app becomes the Mindfulness app, featuring an enhanced Breathe experience, plus a new session type, Reflect. Reflect offers a mindful intention to focus on for as little as one minute that can be done anywhere and at any time. Each Reflect session welcomes the user with a unique, thoughtful notion to consider that invites a positive frame of mind. For example, the user may see something like “Recall a time recently when you felt a sense of calm. Bring that feeling into this moment,” or “Reflect on one thing you’re grateful for and think about why you appreciate it so much.” Both the Breathe and Reflect experiences also offer tips to help users get more from each session and feature beautiful new animations.
 
Sleeping Respiratory Rate
 
Today, Apple Watch helps users meet their sleep goals by establishing a pre-bedtime routine, and tracks metrics like time asleep, heart rate, and blood oxygen. watchOS 8 gives users even more insight into their overall wellness by tracking sleeping respiratory rate, which is the number of breaths per minute. To do this, Apple Watch uses the built-in accelerometer to measure respiratory rate while sleeping, and this information can be viewed, along with trends over time, in the Health app on iPhone®. This metric is also available for developers to use with permission through HealthKit®.
 
Portraits Watch Face and Photos
 
The Photos face is the most popular Apple Watch face, and watchOS 8 introduces new ways to view and engage with users’ favorite photos right from their wrist. The new Portraits watch face brings to life stunning portrait photos shot on iPhone with an immersive, multilayered effect, intelligently recognizing faces in photos and cropping in to highlight the subject. The Photos app is also redesigned, offering new ways to view and navigate collections, Memories and Featured Photos now sync to Apple Watch, and photos can be shared through Messages and Mail with the new Share Sheet.
 
Messages and Contacts
 
Communicating on Apple Watch is even easier with new tools in Messages. Users can combine the use of Scribble, dictation, and emoji all within the same message, and for dictated messages, they have the option to edit the presented text. To easily add even more expression to a message, users can simply enter a word or phrase and select from hundreds of trending GIFs.
 
watchOS 8 also brings the Contacts app to Apple Watch, providing a simple way for users to browse, add, and edit contacts, and share contacts directly from the app.
 
Focus
 
watchOS 8 supports Focus, a powerful set of tools available in iOS 15 to help users reduce distraction and be in the moment. Apple Watch will automatically align with any Focus set on iOS, so that notifications from people and apps are filtered based on what a user is currently doing. Focus uses on-device intelligence to make suggestions based on usage patterns — for example, when starting a workout on Apple Watch, the Focus for fitness is suggested.
 
Additional watchOS 8 Updates
 
Privacy
 
Apple believes privacy is a fundamental human right. Since privacy is particularly important for Health and identification, Health data is encrypted on device or in iCloud® with iCloud sync. For identification, Identity Cards in Wallet are encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element, the same hardware technology used to keep Apple Pay private and secure. Apple cannot see when or where digital IDs are presented when using a driver’s license or state ID.
 
Availability
 
The developer beta of watchOS 8 is available to Apple Developer Program members at developer.apple.com starting today. A public beta will be available to watchOS users next month at beta.apple.com. watchOS 8 will be available this fall as a free software update for Apple Watch Series 3 or later paired with iPhone 6s or later, running iOS 15. Some features may not be available in all regions or all languages, or on all devices. Features are subject to change. For more information, visit apple.com/watchos/watchos-preview.
 
Footnotes
 
1 Digital car keys require a participating car manufacturer and will be coming later this year.
2 Support for new keys in Apple Wallet® requires a compatible door lock for homes, offices, and hotels that will be available through third parties.

Monterey adds new ways to connect with friends and family, work smarter across devices, and stay focused
     CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Apple® today previewed macOS® Monterey, the latest version of the world’s most advanced desktop operating system. macOS Monterey comes with new ways for users to connect, get more done, and work more fluidly across their Apple devices. SharePlay™, a new feature in FaceTime®, lets users share experiences together, and Shared with You makes it easy to discover and enjoy content shared through Messages right in Photos, Safari®, Apple Podcasts®, Apple News®, and the Apple TV® app. A major update to Safari features a gorgeous streamlined tab bar and powerful tab organization with Tab Groups, Shortcuts comes to the Mac® to automate everyday tasks, and Focus helps users stay on task and reduce distractions. Additionally, Universal Control and AirPlay® to Mac are new Continuity features that offer more ways to work effortlessly across Apple devices. macOS Monterey will support the broadest lineup of Macs in history, including the latest iMac®, MacBook Air®, 13-inch MacBook Pro®, and Mac mini®, as well as Apple’s Intel-based Macs.
 This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210607005652/en/ Unveiled at WWDC21, macOS Monterey gives users the power to accomplish more than ever. (Photo: Business Wire) 
“macOS Monterey is packed with features that help Mac users get more done, connect with friends and family in amazing new ways, and work across Mac and iPad more seamlessly than ever before,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “We think our customers are going to love browsing the web with Safari’s new tab design, enjoying shared experiences with SharePlay in FaceTime, and using their Mac and other Apple devices together in new ways with Universal Control and AirPlay to Mac.”
 
Getting More Done with Mac
 
New tools in macOS Monterey are designed to help users get more done, stay focused, and collaborate:
 
— Already the world’s fastest browser, Safari now reimagines the browsing experience with a new tab design that lets users see more of the page as they scroll. A new tab bar takes on the color of the webpage and combines tabs, the tool bar, and the search field into a single compact design. Tab Groups offer a new way to easily save and manage tabs — great for planning trips, shopping, or storing the tabs users visit daily. Tab Groups also sync across Mac®, iPhone®, and iPad®, so users can continue their project from anywhere and easily share tabs with friends and family.
 
— Shortcuts arrives on the Mac to help users automate everyday tasks and achieve peak productivity. Just like on iPhone and iPad, Shortcuts on Mac lets users quickly accomplish tasks with the apps they use the most. With a rich gallery of pre-built actions designed just for Mac, users can instantly share files, make animated GIFs, and more. Power users looking to take things further can use the Shortcuts Editor on Mac to customize shortcuts to match their workflows. Shortcuts is integrated throughout macOS, including the menu bar, Finder®, Spotlight®, and even hands-free with Siri® — making it easy to run shortcuts no matter which app the user is in. Users can easily import existing Automator workflows into Shortcuts and be up and running right away.
 
— New features in Notes help users stay organized, collaborate, and create notes from anywhere. Quick Note is a new way for users to jot down notes on any app or website systemwide, making it easy to capture thoughts and ideas wherever inspiration strikes. Users can also add links from an app to their Quick Note to create context, even on a website in Safari or an address in Maps. As users work through projects in Notes with friends or colleagues, they can add mentions, see everyone’s edits in the new Activity View, and categorize their Notes with tags to quickly and easily find them in the new Tag Browser and in tag-based Smart Folders.
 
— With Focus, Mac users can stay in the moment by automatically filtering out notifications unrelated to their current activity. Users can signal their status to let others know when they are focusing and not available. When a user has Focus set on one device, it automatically sets across their other devices and can be customized based on their current activity — whether they are preparing for a presentation or wrapping up an assignment for school.
 
All New Ways to Stay Connected
 
macOS Monterey provides meaningful new ways to connect and enjoy time with friends, family, and colleagues:
 
— FaceTime now includes a suite of new audio and video features that make calls feel more natural and lifelike. With spatial audio, voices in a FaceTime call sound like they are coming from where the person is positioned on the screen, while Voice Isolation ensures the user’s voice is crystal clear and uses machine learning to eliminate background noise, and Wide Spectrum allows all the sound in the area to come through so participants can hear everything. Portrait mode taps into the Apple Neural Engine in the M1 chip to blur the user’s background for a stunning video effect, and a new Grid View shows participants in same-sized tiles.
 
— SharePlay is a powerful set of system features that enables users to have shared experiences while on a FaceTime call. Users can share their favorite music, TV shows, movies, projects, and more with friends and family in real time — kicking off a shared listening party, watching movies and shows, collaborating in apps through screen sharing, and more. With an API built for easy adoption, third-party developers can bring their own apps right into FaceTime.
 
— Shared with You makes it easy to locate and enjoy all the great content that’s shared through Messages, including photos, videos, articles, and more, right from a Shared with You tab within Photos, Safari, Apple Podcasts, Apple News, and the Apple TV app.
 
New Ways to Work Across Apple Devices
 
Working across Apple devices is now better than ever with new Continuity features:
 
— Universal Control lets users work with a single mouse and keyboard and move between Mac and iPad for a seamless experience, with no setup required. Users can even drag and drop content back and forth between devices — great for sketching a drawing with Apple Pencil® on iPad and placing it into a Keynote® slide on the Mac.
 
— With AirPlay to Mac, users can play, present, and share just about anything — from the latest movies and games to vacation photos and presentations — from their iPhone or iPad right to their Mac’s stunning Retina® display. The Mac’s high-fidelity sound system can also be used as an AirPlay speaker, so users can play music or podcasts on their Mac, or use their Mac as a secondary speaker for multiroom audio.

Apple previews major updates to FaceTime, new Focus features to reduce distraction, enhanced on-device intelligence to discover information, and more ways to explore the world using Maps, Weather, and Wallet
     CUPERTINO, California--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Apple® today announced iOS 15, a major update with powerful features that enhance the iPhone® experience. iOS 15 makes FaceTime® calls more natural, introduces SharePlay™ for shared experiences, helps users focus and be in the moment with new ways to manage notifications, and brings more intelligence to photos and search to quickly access information. Apple Maps unveils beautiful new ways to explore the world, Weather is redesigned with full-screen maps and more graphical displays of data, Wallet adds support for home keys and ID cards, and browsing the internet with Safari® is even simpler with a new tab bar design and Tab Groups. iOS 15 also includes new privacy controls in Siri®, Mail, and more places across the system to further protect user information.
 This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210607005654/en/ iOS 15 introduces SharePlay in FaceTime, Live Text using on-device intelligence, redesigned Notifications, and more. (Photo: Business Wire) 
“For many customers, iPhone has become indispensable, and this year we’ve created even more ways it can enhance our daily lives,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “iOS 15 helps users stay connected while sharing experiences in real time, gives them new tools to help reduce distraction and find focus, uses intelligence to enhance the photos experience, and, with huge upgrades to Maps, brings new ways to explore the world. We can’t wait for customers to experience it.”
 
More Natural FaceTime Calls and Shared Experiences with SharePlay
 
FaceTime helps customers easily connect with those who matter most and with iOS 15, conversations with friends and family feel even more natural. With spatial audio, voices in a FaceTime call sound as if they are coming from where the person is positioned on the screen,1 and new microphone modes separate the user’s voice from background noise. Inspired by the stunning portrait photos taken on iPhone, Portrait mode is now available for FaceTime and designed specifically for video calls, so users can blur their background and put themselves in focus.2 While using Group FaceTime, a new grid view enables participants to see more faces at the same time.
 
Users can now share experiences with SharePlay while connecting with friends on FaceTime, including listening to songs together with Apple Music®, watching a TV show or movie in sync, or sharing their screen to view apps together. SharePlay works across iPhone, iPad®, and Mac®, and with shared playback controls, anyone in a SharePlay session can play, pause, or jump ahead. SharePlay even extends to Apple TV®, so users can watch shows or movies on a big screen while connecting over FaceTime, and SharePlay will keep everyone’s playback in sync. Disney+, ESPN+, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount+, Pluto TV, TikTok, Twitch, and many others are integrating SharePlay into their apps — creating entirely new ways to connect.
 
FaceTime calls also extend beyond Apple devices with the ability to create a link from iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and share it through Messages, Calendar, Mail, or third-party apps, so anyone can join a FaceTime call from their web browser on Android and Windows devices.3 FaceTime calls on the web remain end-to-end encrypted, so privacy is not compromised.
 
Tools to Find Focus
 
iOS 15 delivers powerful tools that help users focus and reduce distraction. Focus is a new feature that filters notifications and apps based on what a user wants to focus on. Customers can set their device to help them be in the moment by creating a custom Focus or selecting a suggested Focus, which uses on-device intelligence to suggest which people and apps are allowed to notify them. Focus suggestions are based on users’ context, like during their work hours or while they’re winding down for bed, and when Focus is set on one Apple device, it automatically applies to their other Apple devices. Users can create Home Screen pages with apps and widgets that apply to moments of focus to only display relevant apps and reduce temptation. When a user’s Focus is blocking incoming notifications, their status is automatically displayed to others in Messages, reflecting that a user is not currently reachable.
 
New Notifications Experience
 
Notifications have been redesigned, adding contact photos for people and larger icons for apps that make them even easier to identify. To help reduce distraction, a new notification summary collects non-time-critical notifications for delivery at a more opportune time, such as in the morning and evening. Using on-device intelligence, notifications are arranged by priority, with the most relevant notifications rising to the top, and based on a user’s interactions with apps. Urgent messages will be delivered immediately, so important communications will not end up in the summary, and it’s easy to temporarily mute any app or messaging thread for the next hour or for the day.
 
On-Device Intelligence Powers Live Text, Advanced Spotlight Search, and More
 
Live Text uses on-device intelligence to recognize text in a photo and allow users to take action. For example, users can search for and locate the picture of a handwritten family recipe, or capture a phone number from a storefront with the option to place a call. With the power of the Apple Neural Engine, the Camera app can also quickly recognize and copy text in the moment, such as the Wi-Fi password displayed at a local coffee shop. With Visual Look Up, users can learn more about popular art and landmarks around the world, plants and flowers found in nature, breeds of pets, and even find books.
 
Spotlight® now uses intelligence to search photos by location, people, scenes, or objects, and using Live Text, Spotlight can find text and handwriting in photos. Spotlight now offers web image search and all-new rich results for actors, musicians, TV shows, and movies. Enhanced results for contacts show recent conversations, shared photos, and even their location if shared through Find My™.
 
Photos includes the biggest update ever to Memories, with a fresh new look, an interactive interface, and integration with Apple Music, which uses on-device intelligence to personalize song suggestions that bring memories to life.
 
A Redesigned Browsing Experience with Safari
 
Safari gets a new design that makes controls easier to reach with one hand and puts content front and center. The new tab bar is compact and lightweight, and floats at the bottom of the screen, so users can easily swipe between tabs. Tab Groups allow users to save tabs and easily access them at any time across iPhone, iPad, or Mac. New features, such as the customizable start page and web extensions on iOS, make Safari even more personal and powerful.
 
Explore the World with Apple Maps
 
Apple is committed to building the world’s best map, and iOS 15 takes Maps even further with brand new ways to navigate and explore. Users will experience significantly enhanced details in cities for neighborhoods, commercial districts, elevation, and buildings, new road colors and labels, custom-designed landmarks, and a new night-time mode with a moonlit glow. This is a whole new way of looking at the world through Maps.
 
When navigating using iPhone or CarPlay®, Maps features a three-dimensional city-driving experience with new road details that help users better see and understand important details like turn lanes, medians, bike lanes, and pedestrian crosswalks.4 Transit riders can find nearby stations more easily and pin favorite lines. Maps automatically follows along with a selected transit route, notifying users when it’s nearly time to disembark, and riders can even keep track on Apple Watch®. With iOS 15, users can simply hold up iPhone, and Maps generates a highly accurate position to deliver detailed walking directions in augmented reality.
 
New Keys and State IDs Come to Apple Wallet
 
Apple Wallet® adds support for additional types of keys, making it possible to access everyday places with just a tap. Last summer, Apple introduced digital car keys, and BMW was the first car company to add its keys, allowing users to tap to unlock. This year, digital car keys get even better with support for Ultra Wideband technology, so users can securely unlock and start their supported vehicle without removing their iPhone from a pocket or bag.5 iPhone can also be used to unlock a user’s home, office, or even a hotel room — all through keys stored in Wallet.6
 
Later this year, customers in participating states in the US will be able to add their driver’s license or state IDs to Wallet. The Transportation Security Administration is working to enable airport security checkpoints as the first place customers can use their digital Identity Card in Wallet. Identity Cards in Wallet are encrypted and safely stored in the Secure Element, the same hardware technology that makes Apple Pay® private and secure.
 
New Privacy Features
 
iOS 15 introduces even more privacy controls to help protect user information. With on-device speech recognition, audio of Siri requests is now processed entirely on iPhone by default,7 and performance improves significantly. Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from learning whether an email has been opened, and hides IP addresses so senders can’t learn a user’s location or use it to build a profile on them. App Privacy Report offers an overview of how apps use the access that has been granted to location, photos, camera, microphone, and contacts in the last seven days, and which other domains are contacted.8
 
Redesigned Weather and Notes Apps
 
Weather includes more graphical displays of weather data, full-screen maps, and dynamic layouts that change based on conditions. Beautifully redesigned animated backgrounds more accurately reflect the sun’s position and precipitation, and notifications highlight when rain or snow starts and stops.
 
Notes adds user-created tags that make it easy to quickly categorize notes, and mentions allow members of shared notes to notify one another of important updates. An all-new Activity view shows the recent history of a shared note.
 
Additional Features

The developer preview of iOS 15 is available to Apple Developer Program members at developer.apple.com starting today, and a public beta will be available to iOS users next month at beta.apple.com.

New features help users control and monitor apps’ use of their data
     CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Apple® today previewed powerful new privacy protections in iOS 15, iPadOS® 15, macOS® Monterey, and watchOS® 8, which help users better control and manage access to their data. These features represent the latest innovations in Apple’s legacy of privacy leadership, as the company has continually expanded its commitment to privacy and encouraged change across the industry with features like App Tracking Transparency and Privacy Nutrition Labels on the App Store®.
 This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210607005653/en/ Safari Privacy Report shows you all the cross-site trackers that are being blocked by Intelligent Tracking Prevention in Safari. (Photo: Business Wire) 
“Privacy has been central to our work at Apple from the very beginning,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “Every year, we push ourselves to develop new technology to help users take more control of their data and make informed decisions about whom they share it with. This year’s updates include innovative features that give users deeper insights and more granular control than ever before.”
 
Protect Data from Third Parties
 
In the Mail app, Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from using invisible pixels to collect information about the user. The new feature helps users prevent senders from knowing when they open an email, and masks their IP address so it can’t be linked to other online activity or used to determine their location.
 
For a number of years, Intelligent Tracking Prevention has helped protect Safari® users from unwanted tracking by using on-device machine learning to stop trackers while allowing websites to function normally. This year, Intelligent Tracking Prevention is getting even stronger by also hiding the user’s IP address from trackers. This means they can’t utilize the user’s IP address as a unique identifier to connect their activity across websites and build a profile about them.
 
Check Up on App Privacy
 
With App Privacy Report, users can see how often each app has used the permission they’ve previously granted to access their location, photos, camera, microphone, and contacts during the past seven days.1 Users can check whether this makes sense to them, and take action by going to the app in Settings if it doesn’t. Users can also find out with whom their data may be shared by seeing all the third-party domains an app is contacting.
 
Process Audio of Siri Requests on Device
 
With on-device speech recognition, the audio of users’ requests is processed right on their iPhone® or iPad® by default. This addresses one of the biggest privacy concerns for voice assistants, which is unwanted audio recording. For many requests, Siri® processing is also moving on device, enabling requests to be processed without an internet connection, such as launching apps, setting timers and alarms, changing settings, or controlling music.
 
Enhance Internet Privacy with iCloud+
 
iCloud+℠ combines everything customers love about iCloud® with new premium features, including iCloud Private Relay, Hide My Email, and expanded HomeKit® Secure Video support, at no additional cost.2
 
Private Relay is a new internet privacy service that’s built right into iCloud, allowing users to connect to and browse the web in a more secure and private way. When browsing with Safari, Private Relay ensures all traffic leaving a user’s device is encrypted, so no one between the user and the website they are visiting can access and read it, not even Apple or the user’s network provider. All the user’s requests are then sent through two separate internet relays. The first assigns the user an anonymous IP address that maps to their region but not their actual location. The second decrypts the web address they want to visit and forwards them to their destination. This separation of information protects the user’s privacy because no single entity can identify both who a user is and which sites they visit.
 
Expanding on the capabilities of Sign in with Apple, Hide My Email lets users share unique, random email addresses that forward to their personal inbox anytime they wish to keep their personal email address private. Built directly into Safari, iCloud settings, and Mail, Hide My Email also enables users to create and delete as many addresses as needed at any time, helping give users control of who is able to contact them.3
 
iCloud+ expands built-in support for HomeKit Secure Video, so users can connect more cameras than ever before in the Home app, while giving them end-to-end encrypted storage for home security video footage that will not count against their storage capacity. HomeKit Secure Video also ensures that activity detected by users’ security cameras is analyzed and encrypted by their Apple devices at home before being securely stored in iCloud.
 
Additional Features for Users and Developers
 
These releases also feature powerful new tools that help developers enhance app functionality while preserving user privacy.

With iOS 15, iPhone and Apple Watch users now have the ability to share health data with loved ones or a care network, view Trends, and measure their Walking Steadiness
     CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Apple® today previewed advanced consumer health and wellness insights for users, as well as new tools for supporting loved ones. Building on the current innovative health features of iPhone® and Apple Watch®, iOS 15 gives users the ability to securely share their data with important people in their life, like a family member or physician, and receive insights into the health trends of their loved ones. Additionally, new tools in iOS 15 can be used to identify, measure, and understand changes in a person’s health data.
 This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210607005660/en/ iOS 15 brings secure sharing and new insights for users within the Health app. (Photo: Business Wire) 
“This past year has emphasized the importance of health, and we’re enabling our users to take a more active role in their well-being. We’ve added powerful features that give users the most comprehensive set of insights to better understand their health trends over time,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Many people around the world are caring for someone, and we want to provide a secure and private way for users to have a trusted partner on their health journey. We’re excited to bring these innovative tools directly into users’ hands.”
 
Health Sharing
 
With iOS 15, users can choose to securely give a loved one visibility into their health and wellness data, enabling them to have more meaningful conversations and provide support — even from afar — as they follow important alerts and changes over time.
 
In the Health app, a new Sharing tab lets users privately share their data with a trusted partner or caregiver. Users have full control over which data they share and with whom, whether they’re an aging parent who shares their activity or heart health data with a family member, a partner who chooses to share their fertility window insights, or a person with Parkinson’s disease who wants to share their mobility data with a physical therapist. For the person receiving this information, shared data is presented with important insights and trends highlighted.
 
Having meaningful conversations with a doctor about everyday activities during a visit is a key part of managing health, but it can be difficult to remember the details. With user permission, the Health app can keep track of valuable information, helping bridge the gap of what a person experiences between clinic appointments. Now, users in the US can choose to share certain types of health data — like heart rate, detected falls, hours of sleep, or exercise minutes — with their doctor, for more informed conversations. At participating healthcare organizations, a physician can review the Apple Health app data that a user chooses to share directly in the electronic health records system.
 
Trends
 
The Health app adds trend analysis for 20 types of data — ranging from resting heart rate to sleep to cardio fitness — so users can easily see how a given metric is progressing. A critical part of maintaining personal wellness is tracking changes in health, which can be subtle and easy to miss. For users looking to keep an eye on their data over time, Trends is a new way to intelligently and proactively highlight important changes, and surfaces the information in a way that’s easy to understand.
 
Users can also keep tabs on goals, like increasing running distance or mindful minutes. For those looking to monitor insights across areas like insulin delivery, trend analysis applies to data from third-party devices connected to the Health app.
 
With optional notifications, Trends can highlight long-term changes in health, so a user can celebrate progress toward a goal, or discuss with a doctor or care team.
 
Walking Steadiness
 
More than 37 million people each year require medical attention as a result of a fall, which can often be a tipping point for more serious conditions and a loss of independence.1 Walking Steadiness on iPhone is an industry first, providing insight into fall risk by capturing important mobility data as users walk with their iPhone. Currently, fall risk is assessed by a care provider through a questionnaire and an in-person evaluation. Walking Steadiness offers the added ability to capture everyday movements and surface classifications within the Health app as OK, Low, or Very Low, allowing users to proactively take action to help reduce their risk of falling.
 
Walking Steadiness uses custom algorithms to assess balance, stability, and coordination through built-in motion sensors on iPhone. This first-of-its-kind metric was established using real-world data from the Apple Heart and Movement Study, with more than 100,000 participants across all ages — the largest data set ever used to study fall risk.
 
In addition to alerting users of possible fall risk, Walking Steadiness helps users meet their stability goals. Users can choose to receive a notification when their score is Low or Very Low, and be directed to curated visual exercises that are based on clinically validated methods to increase strength and balance.
 
Privacy 
 
Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s health features. Health data is under a user’s control, with granular control over which data types they choose to share and with whom. Data is encrypted when in transit and while at rest on a user’s device when locked behind a passcode, Face ID®, or Touch ID®. Apple does not have access to this information when a user chooses to share it with a loved one or doctor.
 
Additional Health and Wellness Updates 
 
Availability
 
The developer preview of iOS 15 is available to Apple Developer Program members at developer.apple.com starting today, and a public beta will be available to iOS users next month at beta.apple.com. New software features will be available this fall as a free software update for iPhone 6s and later. Walking Steadiness will be available this fall as a free software update for iPhone 8 and later. Features are subject to change. Some features may not be available in all regions or all languages, or on all devices. For more information, visit apple.com/ios/health. The new Mindfulness app and respiratory rate during sleep measurement will be available on watchOS 8 this fall as a free software update for Apple Watch Series 3 or later paired with iPhone 6s or later, running iOS 15.

New widget layouts for the Home Screen and App Library offer simple ways to personalize the iPad experience and organize apps. Translate delivers new features for translating text and conversations, and users can now build apps for iPhone® and iPad, on iPad, with Swift Playgrounds®. iPadOS 15 also includes new privacy controls in Siri®, Mail, and more places across the system to further protect user information.
 This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210607005648/en/ iPadOS 15 makes features like Split View and Slide Over easier to discover and use, and more powerful. (Photo: Business Wire) 
“We’re excited to make the iPad experience even better with iPadOS 15,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “With more intuitive multitasking, a new Home Screen design with integrated widgets and the App Library, systemwide note taking with Quick Note, Translate designed for iPad, SharePlay, a redesigned Safari experience, new tools to stay focused, and more, users can now be even more productive.”
 
Get More Done with Multitasking and Keyboard Shortcuts
 
iPadOS 15 makes working with multiple apps easier than ever. A new multitasking menu appears at the top of apps, letting users go into Split View or Slide Over with just a tap. Users now have quick access to the Home Screen when using Split View, making it easier to get to the right app. Using the new shelf, they can also multitask with apps that have multiple windows like Safari® and Pages®, as well as quickly preview emails.
 
The experience with an external keyboard allows users to get more done with all-new keyboard shortcuts and a redesign of the menu bar. Users can quickly set up and switch between Split View and Slide Over with new shortcuts for multitasking right from the keyboard.
 
Organize and Personalize iPad with Widgets and the App Library
 
Users can now place widgets among apps on Home Screen pages, providing more information at a glance and offering a more personalized experience. Designed specifically for the larger display of iPad, a new, larger widget size is perfect for showcasing videos, music, games, photos, and more. iPadOS 15 also brings all-new widgets for App Store, Find My™, Game Center, Mail, and Contacts.
 
Also coming to iPad is the App Library, automatically organizing apps into helpful categories like Productivity, Games, and Recently Added, and allowing users to access all their apps right from the Dock.
 
Capturing Thoughts with Quick Note and Organizing with Tags
 
Note taking on iPad gets even better with new features that make it easier to capture and organize thoughts. Notes goes systemwide with Quick Note, a fast and easy way to take notes anywhere across the system. Whether browsing in Safari or finding a restaurant on Yelp, users can bring up Quick Note anywhere to jot down a thought and add links, providing an easy way to get back to exactly what they were looking at.
 
Notes also has new ways to organize, collaborate, and capture information. Tags make it easy to categorize notes and find them quickly with an all-new Tag Browser and tag-based Smart Folders. For users working with others in shared notes, mentions create a way to notify collaborators and link them back to the note, and a new Activity view shows recent updates in the note.
 
More Natural FaceTime Calls and Shared Experiences with SharePlay
 
FaceTime® helps users easily connect with those who matter most, and with iPadOS 15, conversations with friends and family feel even more natural. Users can now share experiences with SharePlay™ while connecting with friends on FaceTime, including listening to songs together with Apple Music®, watching a TV show or movie in sync, or sharing their screen to view apps together. Shared playback controls let anyone play, pause, or jump ahead. Users can extend playback to Apple TV®, and watch it on their TV while sharing the moment with friends and family connected over FaceTime. SharePlay also lets users share their screen, perfect for browsing the web together.
 
A Redesigned Browsing Experience with Safari
 
Safari gets a new tab design that lets users see more of the page as they browse. A new tab bar takes on the color of the webpage and combines tabs, the toolbar, and the search field into a single, compact design. Tab Groups offer a new way to easily save and manage tabs — great for planning trips, shopping, or storing frequently visited tabs. Tab Groups also sync across Mac® and iPhone, so users can continue their project from anywhere or easily share them with friends and family. Safari on iPad also now supports web extensions, available from the App Store®.
 
Tools to Find Focus
 
iPadOS 15 delivers powerful tools that help users focus and reduce distractions. Focus is a new feature that filters notifications based on what a user is doing. Users can set their device to help them be in the moment by creating a custom Focus or selecting a suggested one based on their context, like during their work hours or while they’re winding down for bed. Users can also create Home Screen pages with apps and widgets that apply to moments of focus to only display relevant apps and reduce temptation.
 
A new notification summary offers an organized collection of notifications that can be delivered any time the user chooses, such as in the morning and evening, making it easy to catch up on the day’s activity at their convenience.
 
On-Device Intelligence Powers New Photo Features
 
Live Text uses on-device intelligence to recognize text in a photo and allow users to take action.1 For example, a snapshot of a storefront may reveal a phone number and the option to place a call. With Visual Look Up, users can identify objects within a photo, such as a type of flower or dog breed.
 
Spotlight® now adds the ability to search the Photos app and web images, and has all-new rich results for contacts with context like recent conversations, shared photos, and their location if shared through Find My. Leveraging Live Text, Spotlight makes it easy to look up a photo of a public transit map, receipt, or a screenshot of a cooking recipe. Live Text also works with handwritten text — great for searching photos of whiteboards or notes.
 
Translate Comes to iPad with New Ways to Communicate
 
The Translate app comes to iPad with new features that make conversations easier and more natural. When using the Translate app, Auto Translate detects when someone is speaking, and in which language, so users can converse naturally without having to tap a microphone button. For even more personal conversations, face-to-face view allows two people to sit across from each other with iPad between them and see translations of the conversation from their own side. Text can now be translated anywhere on iPad by selecting it and tapping Translate, and handwritten text can also be translated. In combination with Live Text, users can even translate text in photos.
 
Build Apps with Swift Playgrounds
 
Swift Playgrounds is the best and easiest way to learn how to code. And now with Swift Playgrounds 4,2 users have the tools to build iPhone and iPad apps right on their iPad and submit them directly to the App Store, offering new ways for anyone to create apps and share them with the world.3 Code is immediately reflected in the live preview while building apps, and users can run their apps full screen to test them out. A new open project format based on Swift packages can open and be edited in Swift Playgrounds for iPad as well as within Xcode® on Mac, offering users even more versatility to develop apps across iPad and Mac.

company,1623066780,How Investors Can Use Boredom Arbitrage to Profit,67993585,,AAPL,GuruFocus,"GuruFocus Article or News written by Rupert Hargreaves and the topic is about: Many investors need to trade, patient investors can take advantages of this",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c5e2d89fc6791b60d2a871a05ad8365ff777e93b436fd3b022405eccde8d8791,"One of the easiest and yet simultaneously the most challenging ways to gain an edge over the stock market is to have a long-term investment mentality. It easy if you have the right mindset. Suppose an investor can sit and watch a stock for decades without doing anything to it. Unfortunately, this is not a mindset that all investors have - in fact, it is human nature to seek instant gratification, which can make long-term investing difficult for the majority of people. Overcoming emotions It's incredibly challenging to overcome one's own emotions and focus on a company's long-term potential, not its short-term stock performance. For many investors, sitting still and not doing anything, just waiting for a stock to rise in value year after year, is difficult and takes a lot of restraint. It can also seem lazy. Investors are constantly bombarded with information and stories from the financial world. These can be anything from the latest trading update of a high-profile business to the performance of one of the world's best hedge funds. Unfortunately, this consistent newsflow can produce a fear of missing out. It's something I have suffered from, and I know I'm not alone. Even Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), who is probably one of the most patient investors of all time, has made choices that have been influenced more by emotion than rational decisions. Two examples are his decision to sell a smaller percentage of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A, Financial) (BRK.B, Financial) shares in Apple (AAPL, Financial) last year and his decision to buy ConocoPhillips (COP, Financial) just before the great financial crisis. Even Buffett is not immune to the psychological biases that can drive humans and impair returns. To understand how damaging these biases can be, let's look at research conducted by Dalbar, Inc. This company studies investor behaviour and analyzes investor market returns. According to the research company, for the 20 years ended Dec. 31, 2019, the S&P 500 index returned 6.06% per annum. Over the same time frame, the average equity fund investor made a market return of just 4.25%. The difference in returns can be explained by emotional investor behavior. This study also showed that approximately 70% of average investor underperformance occurred during only 10 critical periods, periods in which investors withdrew their money due to significant market drawdowns. Boredom arbitrage So, why do investors try to beat the market by trying to time the market? One answer to this is boredom and a belief they could do better. Boredom can explain a lot of unwise financial decisions. However, it's also something investors can take advantage of if they know where to look. Several years ago, hedge fund Logo's Capital published a letter which contained a quote presented by Christoper Mayer: ""Boredom can explain a lot. It can explain all kinds of financial behavior. And there is definitely a 'boredom arbitrage' to take advantage of in the markets."" The concept of boredom arbitrage is something that has always fascinated me. There's a tremendous amount of evidence which supports the notion that investors can gain an edge over the market by embracing boredom. Some great examples include Berkshire, Amazon (AMZN, Financial) and Microsoft (MSFT, Financial). These stocks have been some of the best investments to own over the past 20 to 30 years, but they've suffered significant drawdowns during that period. I don't have the exact figures, but I'm willing to bet that there's only a tiny percentage of investors still holding these companies today that bought 20 to 30 years ago. The concept of boredom arbitrage is very similar to the idea of time arbitrage. In a market constantly dominated by short-term performance metrics, investors can gain an edge by focusing on a company's long-term potential rather than its quarterly profit growth. Buying when investor sentiment takes a negative look at companies with a long-term competitive advantage can lead to market-beating returns over the years. These concepts are not straightforward to implement. However, just by being aware of them, it is easier to prepare a defence. Disclosure: The author owns no share mentioned."

What Happened: Some developers hated Apple’s latest new digital-ad industry-disrupting privacy rules while others detested App Store’s 30% commission on digital revenue. Apple has refuted the monopoly allegations. The iPhone maker justified its commission as in line with rivals’ and the fair for the value it has created. Apple had blamed Epic for attempting to bypass its fair dues. Apple halved its app store commission to 15% for apps with $1 million or less in revenue after the August Epic lawsuit. Interestingly, only a small share of apps generates over $1 million. Apple is estimated to showcase its latest operating systems, including iOS 15, with additional privacy features, changes to notifications, and messaging system features, which compete against Facebook Inc’s (NASDAQ: FB) messaging app WhatsApp. Facebook protested Apple’s 2020 plans of introducing new privacy tools in its iOS 14 mobile operating system over ad business disruption concerns. Apple’s privacy-policy changes, including user tracking consent, have fueled developers’ concerns. Though Apple defended the policy citing user privacy protection, Facebook calls it foul play. Apple’s 2020 billings and sales facilitated by its App Store rose an estimated 24% to $643 billion compared to 2019, fueled by quarantined users. The shares almost doubled in value in 2020. The number of available apps in the App Store has grown from 500 in 2008 to 1.8 million at present. Why It Matters: Apple spends over $50 million on the conference with 6,000 developer attendees in person and tens of millions more online. The 2021’s 200-plus sessions were being held virtually. The Epic trial judge confronted Apple with survey data that disclosed 39% of developers were either very dissatisfied or somewhat dissatisfied with Apple’s distribution services. Interestingly, over 90% of Apple developers do not plan to sever ties, Reuters reports based on Creative Strategies CEO Ben Bajarin. Smaller independent developers who paid smaller fees preferred Apple compared to larger company developers who pay higher fees. Over 50% of the developers sought a fee cap at 10% and more clarity over app rejection and a possible remedy. Price action: AAPL shares traded lower by 0.77% at $124.92 in the market session on the last check Monday. © 2021 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

Progress on that legislation could potentially give the Materials, Energy, and Industrial sectors a boost, while the inflation data might give investors more clues about the state of the economy following last week’s payrolls data.  With all this to think over, the market barely moved overnight in pre-market trading and looks a bit flat to start the week. Even the volatile commodity markets are mostly treading water this morning, and so are bonds.  Friday’s high of 4233 for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) put it just five points away from the all-time peak posted a month ago today. Breaking through that 4238 barrier and closing above it in any sort of meaningful way might be what the SPX needs to crack open the narrow trading range it’s been in since early April, marked by relatively light daily moves. Overall, the SPX hasn’t traded below 4056 or above 4238 over the last two months. That’s a range of just 4% of the average SPX value for that time frame. Some of the fear that haunted Wall Street ahead of the jobs report seems to have dissipated. You can perhaps see that in the Treasury market, where the 10-year yield fell back toward recent lows to finish Friday near 1.55%, not far from long-term support that technical analysts see at 1.52%. It’s at 1.57% early Monday. Volatility also fell on Friday.  Meanwhile, the relationship between Wall Street and Tech stocks lately is like a teenage love affair. All smiles and hugs one day, ignoring each other the next.  Friday was another case of market puppy love for Tech after the jobs report appeared to lower the chance of a near-term Fed tapering its monetary stimulus. A tapering, if it happens, could mean higher Treasury yields, which often hurts growth stocks like some in the Tech sector.  A bit of Friday’s Tech strength might also have come in anticipation of this week’s Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Things kick off this morning with a speech from AAPL CEO Tim Cook. WWDC is the venue Apple uses to reveal the next operating system for the iPhone. iOS 15 will likely be the most important software update to come out of the conference, Tech publication Wired noted. So consider keeping an eye on anything coming out of that conference this week if you want more direction on where Tech might go from here. AAPL hasn’t performed well so far this year, but you can’t overlook its $2.1 trillion market cap and the impact that can have on broader indices.  Tech gains Friday took a lot of their momentum from the semiconductor sub-sector, which rose nearly 2.5%. It may feel like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) has done nothing but rise this year, but it actually treaded water much of the time and is up about 12% year-to-date, right about even with the SPX. The usual suspects like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) helped chips finish last week with a boom, but we’ll see if investors continue to show the same appetite in the coming days.  Another stock in the spotlight today is Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB), which awaits an FDA decision on whether to approve BIIB’s Alzheimer’s disease drug. The stock moved higher in pre-market trading, but an FDA advisory panel of outside experts has recommended against approval, and the FDA usually follows its panels’ advice. This might be an interesting one to watch.  They weren’t showing much appetite for the dollar going into the weekend, as the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) fell back near its psychological support level of 90. Earlier last week the dollar had started moving higher, perhaps on hopes of a major jump in U.S. May jobs growth. The dollar got a bit firmer early Monday but it’s nothing to write home about.  The jobs growth number of 559,000 was solid but not eye-popping, and didn’t exactly scare the children, so to speak, about the chance of any near-term Fed stimulus tapering. That may be why the dollar stepped back a bit even as the stock market kicked into higher gear to end last week. Remember, the dollar tends to be inversely correlated to commodity prices. Weakness in the greenback could provide more ammunition for crude futures, which already are the highest in seven years.  As stocks inch toward record highs, another metric keeps losing ground. Volatility, represented by the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) dropped below 17 on Friday after a failed test of the 20 level earlier in the week. With Friday’s jobs report possibly reducing tension a bit around possible Fed tapering, it’s conceivable VIX might stay lidded. On the other hand, there’s always a chance it could get a jolt, whether it’s from the consumer price index (CPI) data due out later this week or any Fed comments.  As for the Fed, their pre-meeting quiet period is approaching. Focus is likely to turn toward next week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting June 15-16, but the CPI data looms large ahead of that. Looking back once more at last Friday’s jobs report after a weekend of perspective, the headline number of 559,000 jobs created in May came in a little light, but the market seemed to like it because it potentially takes some of the inflationary pressure off.  Based on the numbers we saw, it’s unlikely that the narrative we’ve had over the last month really changes. That means every piece of news from the Fed or anything we think implies something the Fed is doing leads to this tug of war of value vs. growth vs. fixed income. It’s probably not changing much over the next month.  Meanwhile, even though crude has been on a pretty incredible tear, a lot of the other commodities have at least leveled off a bit. They’re not on quite the tear they once were, so that could also be taking inflationary pressures off the table.  Looking ahead this week, we have Thursday’s consumer price index (CPI) front and center, along with expected earnings from Chewy, Inc. (NYSE: CHWY) and GameStop (NYSE: GME). We’ll talk more about CPI tomorrow. The so-called “meme” stocks like GME and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) remain in focus after both eased slightly on Friday. It was actually kind of surprising not to see double-digit moves for either after so much drama earlier last week.  Anyone thinking of dipping their toe into any of these meme stocks should remember that elevated volatility means elevated risk. Now more than ever, have a plan for your trading and plan your risk before the trade.  That goes for any trades, even beyond the most volatile stocks. We’re approaching mid-year, so it’s not too early for long-term investors to start thinking about examining their portfolios to see what’s working and what’s not so far in 2021. Also, consider fixed income vs. stock market exposure. What you see now might not match the plan you started the year with, so check and see if any adjustments need to be made and if you remain adequately diversified.   CHART OF THE DAY:  CRUDE WAY OUT IN FRONT. The crude market (/CL—candlestick) remains on a tear, closing in on $70 a barrel as travel demand continues to rise. Other commodities ($BCOM—purple line), aren’t keeping up, as this year-to-date chart shows. They’re up just 19% so far in 2021, compared with nearly 47% for crude. A softening dollar could help inject further strength into crude and other commodities if it continues. Data Sources: Bloomberg, CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.   Re-Constructing Jobs: One interesting point some analysts didn’t pick up about the May payrolls data came in the construction sector. While overall construction jobs fell by 20,000, 17,000 of those losses were non-residential specialty trade contractors, a business very subject to small changes in timing of various construction projects.  It’s not really something that plays out as a trend. Instead, it probably reflects various jobs starting and stopping for various reasons, and a lot of those people could have been hired back after the government stopped tracking data for the report. Keep an eye on the June construction job numbers to see if that’s reflected, or if the May number gets revised upward.  It’s stuff like this that makes these reports kind of a snapshot in time, which is why investors should consider tracking data over longer periods to see where all the different puzzle pieces fit.  A Fed President’s Take On Jobs/Inflation: Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, interviewed Friday on CNBC after the jobs report, didn’t say anything that could really be seen as too hawkish, pointing out that the job market still has a long way to go from recovering in the post-Covid era and that the Fed needs to continue watching data. She cast the Fed’s current role as being “deliberately patient.”  Mester doesn’t necessarily believe higher wages are leading to higher prices in some sort of inflationary spiral, as some analysts have feared. It’s something to monitor, Mester said, but she sees no signs of it yet. “At this point, I don’t think we’re anywhere near there,” she told CNBC. “This increase in wages is definitely happening…but it’s not feeding into underlying inflation yet.” Thursday’s consumer price index report for May is the next key read on the inflation picture.  Second-Half Musings: Though some major investment firms have suggested stock market growth might be muted in the second half, at least one research firm recently raised its projections for full-year market progress. Some analysts remain optimistic that the market can again push higher before the end of the year. Research firm CFRA now has an end-of-the-year estimate for the SPX of 4620, representing about a 9% projected price appreciation from Friday’s level. This forecast, CFRA said, incorporates historical precedent, fundamental forecasts, and technical considerations. Sectors with the lowest forward P/E ratios, according to CFRA, include Financials, Health Care, and Utilities. Could more investors pile into these sectors looking for relative bargains? As with everything, only time will tell. Image Sourced from Pixabay

Brooks Kraft/Apple Inc./Handout via REUTERS   Apple Inc (AAPL.O), facing accusations from rivals that it has too much control over its App Store, on Monday outlined plans to increase user privacy and keep consumer data out of other companies’ hands, laying out features including expanded video conferencing and storing virtual government IDs on iPhones. The changes came at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference for software developers, some of whom have started to complain about Apple's grip over which apps can appear on its devices, as well as its 15% to 30% commissions on digital sales. Many of the new features allow users to safeguard data, trusting the information to the Apple brand. Users will be able to scan ID cards in participating U.S. states, and the cards will be encrypted in a user's digital wallet, along with credit cards and transit cards in some U.S. cities. It is working with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration to accept the digital IDs at airports. In many cases, Apple itself cannot see all the information. The company has updated the paid version of its iCloud storage service to include a service that obscures a user's Web-browsing habits, even from Apple. Another new iCloud feature will let users hide their real email address, which has become increasingly used as an identifier for digital marketers to track users. Apple said iCloud pricing will not change with the new features. Apple also tweaked some of its apps and services in ways that could intensify its rivalries with Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) and Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Teams, both of which gained prominence during the pandemic. It updated its FaceTime video chat app to allow scheduling calls with multiple attendees and making the software compatible with Android and Windows devices. Apple also introduced what it calls in-app events, a way for developers to host live events within apps and have those events featured in real time in the App Store. Video game developers, for example, could host live tournaments and market those on the App Store, which Apple's current systems are not built to handle. The move could intensify competition with Facebook Inc (FB.O), which on Monday said it was planning to launch an online events business that would be free until 2023 and thereafter will charge commissions lower than Apple’s 30% fees for the App Store.  Several of the other features Apple introduced Monday, such as the ability to snap a photo of a sign and use artificial intelligence to pluck out the written text, have been present on the rival Android operating system for several years. The rest of Apple's conference is dedicated to technical sessions for developers, some of whom have bristled at its controls and fees. Those issues have come under regulatory scrutiny and are at the heart of an antitrust lawsuit brought by “Fortnite” creator Epic Games, in which a federal judge is considering how to rule.  Apple has said its App Store practices increase the market for mobile software by creating an environment for paid apps that consumers trust, and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and his team did not address frayed developer relations during the presentation. Not all developers have negative sentiments, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive at Creative Strategies, who has been surveying Apple developers and found more than 90% have no plans to stop making apps for Apple devices. However, some complaints are widespread, with more than half of developers saying fees should be capped at 10%, and many wanting more clarity around reasons for rejecting apps from the App Store and how to resolve such issues, Bajarin said.

For anyone fascinated by feuds amongst the mega-caps, there could plenty to savoir at this year's virtual event. As par for the course, Apple is expected to announce iOS upgrades and software improvements for the coming year, but Wedbush’s Daniel Ives also believes the introduction of iOS 15 could create some additional friction in an escalating dispute with a rival tech giant.



“We expect data privacy and security to be a main focus and theme of Cook's keynote as Apple solidifies its privacy policy with the iOS 15 unveil,” the 5-star analyst said. “This follows the iOS 14.5 release which has doubled down on privacy features for the consumer at a time which Apple has directly put itself on a collision course with Facebook around the ability for users to block data tracking.”



That possible conflict aside, various notifications/lock screen changes are also anticipated as part of the update which could also include a “revamped iMessage feature set.”



Ives also expects non-software related announcements. Namely, the analyst thinks a surprise is in store on the hardware front; Ives anticipates an announcement of a new MacBook Pro release, with a 14-inch and 16-inch display “driven by the M1 chip.”



The analyst also thinks there will be “hints around upcoming initiatives with some breadcrumbs dropped as developers crave bigger AR functionality in the works for the coming years.”



Looking ahead, Ives projects that by next summer (2022), the “long-awaited” Apple Glasses will be unveiled. And as if ratcheting up the volume in the Facebook squabble is not enough, Tesla is in Apple’s sights too. By 2024, Ives believes the Apple Car will could see the light of day and assumes “more news/partnerships this summer on this front.”



So, down to business, what does this all mean for AAPL investors? Ives reiterated an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on the shares backed by a $185 price target. Investors could be sitting on gains of 47%, should the forecast play out as expected. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)



Not all on the Street are convinced it is time to load up on Apple stock although the majority remains in the Cupertino giant’s corner. Based on 19 Buys vs. 5 Holds and 2 Sells, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target currently stands at $157.58, suggesting the upcoming year will yield returns of 25%.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) made in its testimony during the Epic Games v. Apple trial is that without the company’s control of app distribution, iPhone owners would have to download or purchase apps from a “flea market.” The App Store, the company claimed, offers a safe, controlled environment built by Apple and app developers should happily pay the company’s commission rates.A report over the weekend in the Washington Post raises questions about the quality of some of the 1.8 million apps available at the App Store. The report claims that 2% of the 1,000 highest-grossing apps available are scams that have cost people an estimated $48 million since the apps have been on the App Store.Apple gets paid for downloads of those apps, just as it does for legitimate apps. The Washington Post noted that since notifying Apple of the 18 scam apps it found, the company has removed 12 of them.The report comes just one day before Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) begins. It is probably safe to say that tension between Apple and app developers runs high. The Epic Games trial has once again stirred up the pot of hard feelings some developers have toward the company.One app developer, Marco Arment (Instapaper, Tumblr, Overcast), points out one obvious fact: “Without our apps, the iPhone has little value to most of its customers today.” While acknowledging the “thousands of Apple employees” who have built the company’s products and platforms, Arment has more pointed comments about Apple’s leadership.
Apple’s a lot of things, and “generous” isn’t one.
But to bully and gaslight developers into thinking that we need to be kissing Apple’s feet for permitting us to add billions of dollars of value to their platform is not only greedy, stingy, and morally reprehensible, but deeply insulting. …
The App Store is merely one platform’s forced distribution gateway, “facilitating” the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor. …
[T]he leaders have already shown us who they really are, what they really think of us, and how much they value our work.
MacRumors reported Monday morning that Apple has reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with a 21-year old college student who sent her iPhone in for repair only to discover that while the phone was being repaired, “technicians posted 10 photos of the Apple customer in ‘various stages of undress and a sex video.'”

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were all down 0.4%-0.7%. The focus now shifts to the G20 countries for a wider agreement on the new tax proposals. The G-7 proposals are seen targeting technology companies that sell services remotely and attribute much of their profits to intellectual properly held in low-tax jurisdictions. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, was trading 0.4% lower after being down 1.7% at one stage. Sentiment for the stock was also pulled down after the search giant agreed to pay $267.48 million to France's antitrust watchdog in a case involving its ad practice A probe by the country’s competition regulator found that Google had abused its market power in the intricate ad business online, where some of its tools have become almost essential for large publishers. The case follows a complaint by News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), French news publishing group Le Figaro and Belgian press group Rossel. The French fine may be small but the finer points hold wider ramifications as the media and publishing industry has for more than a decade accused the internet and social media giants of walking away with the revenues derived from content produced by them. News Corp and Google were at loggerheads in Australia too early this year before the two reached a truce in February. Under a three-year agreement, the search giant will pay for news sourced from the Rupert Murdoch company.    By Subrat Patnaik (Reuters) -Thousands of government, news and social media websites across the globe were coming back online on Tuesday after getting hit by a widespread...

company,1623035040,Apple Staff Pushes Back Against Tim Cook's Call For Return To Office In September: Report,67994931,https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/stephen-l-3kweyop8tt8-unsplash_9.jpg,AAPL,Benzinga,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) employees are not in agreement with a policy that would see them working at their desks three days a week starting early September, the Verge reported....",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0b834a8c8dd75e63030a38d23080ddc40522ae6be524d999002517f4a7d361fe,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) employees are not in agreement with a policy that would see them working at their desks three days a week starting early September, the Verge reported. What Happened: “Apple’s remote/location-flexible work policy, and the communication around it, have already forced some of our colleagues to quit,” said an internal letter addressed to CEO Tim Cook and seen by The Verge. See Also: How to Buy Apple (AAPL) Stock “Without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple,” the letter read.  The letter was reportedly circulated among employees for their signatures Friday afternoon after an internal communication from Tim Cook announced the new policy. The employees outlined specific demands, such as consideration of location-flexible work decisions to be autonomous for a team within the company to decide as are hiring decisions. A formal request for an Apple-wide recurring short survey spanning topics mentioned in the letter. Inclusion of a question about employee churn due to remote work to be added to exit interviews.  The letter also demands an insight be made into the environmental impact of returning to onsite in-person work and how permanent remote-and-location flexibility could offset such an impact. Why It Matters: The letter to Cook started in a channel for “remote work advocates” with 2,800 members on the messaging app software made by Slack Technologies Inc (NYSE: WORK), as per the Verge. Nearly 80 people were involved in writing and editing the self-described “plea.” The authors wrote, “Over the last year we often felt not just unheard, but at times actively ignored.” Other tech giants have taken a more flexible approach to work from home. Last year, Jack Dorsey-led Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) notified its employees by email that it would allow them to work from home as long as they wanted. See Also: Amazon Thinks Future Of Work Is At The Office, Buys Real Estate In Six Major US Cities Also last year, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg told the Verge that the thing that had been “positively surprising to people is that people are more productive working at home than people would have expected. A lot of people are actually saying that they’re more productive now.” Price Action: On Friday, Apple shares closed 1.9% higher at $125.89 in the regular session.

company,1623032460,"Apple Supplier Foxconn's May Revenue Falls Amid Rising COVID-19 Cases In Taiwan, After Q1 Profit Beat",67994933,https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/1600px-foxconn_pardubice_01_1.jpeg,AAPL,Benzinga,Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) supplier Foxconn reported a 9% fall in May revenue on a month-on-month basis and the slowest monthly sales growth in six months on a year-on-year basis....,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1ecb1a79c8794b45b76375083b3451800c420245610a05084f9d4ac4cd900a7b,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) supplier Foxconn reported a 9% fall in May revenue on a month-on-month basis and the slowest monthly sales growth in six months on a year-on-year basis.  What Happened:  The slowdown came as Taiwan, the island country where Foxconn is based, tackles a spike in COVID-19 cases after recording just a few daily infections for months. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (OTC: HNHPF), popularly known as Foxconn, reported a May revenue of NT$455 billion ($16.38 billion), up 17.6% compared with a year ago. The company had reported an April revenue of NT$500.49 billion. The Taiwan-based semiconductor maker had last month warned the ongoing chip crisis could worsen in the current quarter with a business impact of 10%. The company’s first-quarter profit beat estimates, helped by an extended work-from-home boom spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Why It Matters: The company which assembles iPhones at plants in China and India saw first-quarter revenue rise 45% despite a sharp reduction in iPhone production in India due to surging coronavirus cases in the country. Taiwan, at present, is also seeing a spike in COVID-19 infections. Foxconn founder Terry Gou last week announced a charity plan to apply to import 5 million doses of Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE)/BioNTech SE's (NASDAQ: BNTX) COVID-19 vaccine into Taiwan to speed up its vaccination program, as per a Reuters report. Price Action: Foxconn shares closed 1% higher at $8.11 on Friday. Photo by Nadkachna on Wikimedia © 2021 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

What Happened: The U.S. government is set to complete a 100-day review of supply chain gaps in crucial areas, including EVs. The gaps include the minerals used in EV batteries and consumer electronics.  The government is exploring ways to reduce metal usage in new battery chemistries. Democrats are pressing for the majority of U.S.-manufactured cars to be electric by 2030 and every car on the road to be electric by 2040. Securing enough cobalt, lithium, and other raw materials for EV batteries is a major hindrance, with extensive regulatory hurdles and environmental opposition challenging the domestic mines. Biden intended to rely on mines in ally countries for EVs. The domestic recycling initiatives include direct investment in projects and scientific research and Congress-approved funds. Why It Matters: The domestic recycling boost will reduce reliance on mining by breaking down older EVs into component parts for new vehicles. Last fall, China’s Ganfeng Lithium Co announced its plans to build a battery recycling plant in Mexico for the U.S. EV market. The White House expects more plants in the U.S. The initiative includes a heavy emphasis on research and development to drive the use of already-mined metals. The U.S. government estimated the EV revolution to lead to the dumping of 8 million tons of battery scrap in U.S. landfills alone by 2040. Recycling could reduce the projected need for new sources of copper for EV batteries by 55% by 2040. The figure is 25% for lithium and 35% for cobalt and nickel. Recycling will also reduce the demand for new mines. Last fall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) had invested in Nevada’s Redwood Materials recycling firm that will recycle scrap and battery parts from a contractor for Nissan Motor Co Ltd’s (OTC: NSANY) Leaf EV. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) also recycles some battery parts at its Nevada Gigafactory. At the same time, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) has started to recycle old iPhones and other electronics at an Austin, Texas facility. Image Courtesy: Wikimedia Commons © 2021 Benzinga.com.

What Happened: The findings were reportedly published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, which agreed with a report by Heart Rhythm Journal, which in turn claimed that when the iPhone 12 is brought in close contact with certain implantable cardiac devices they are affected. See also: How To Buy Apple Stock “Our study demonstrates that magnet reversion mode may be triggered when the iPhone 12 Pro Max is placed directly on the skin over an implantable cardiac device and thus has the potential to inhibit [life-saving] therapies, “ the Association’s report noted, as per Appleinsider. The Association was reported to have used an iPhone 12 Max phone for its tests against a series of 11 different pacemakers and defibrillators. The medical devices were both “in vivo” — meaning they were implanted in patients or “ex vivo” — meaning they were newly unboxed or not yet implanted devices, as per the Association. Why It Matters: The “iPhone 12 Pro Max was able to trigger magnetic reversion mode at a distance up to 1.5cm [0.6 inches],” said the report, as per AppleInsider. See Also: Apple Fined $2M In Brazil For Shipping iPhone 12 Without Charger ""Our study suggests otherwise as magnet response was demonstrated in 3/3 cases in vivo."" The Association noted that people often put their smartphones in breast pockets over a device that can be in close proximity to cardiac implantable electronic devices, which “can lead to asynchronous pacing or disabling of antitachycardic therapies.” An Apple advisory on MagSafe states, “To avoid any potential interactions with these devices, keep your iPhone and MagSafe accessories a safe distance away from your  device (more than 6 inches / 15 cm apart or more than 12 inches / 30 cm apart if wirelessly charging).” Apple launched the iPhone 12 lineup in October last year.

We’re seeing a bit of a selloff this morning, but it’s probably nothing to get too excited about considering how many days...",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3a2a1fffeb207ea3749fa38ff360784d5dfdbd2d48f8e6f8edf0428c66a56a87,"The holding pattern continues to hold.  We’re seeing a bit of a selloff this morning, but it’s probably nothing to get too excited about considering how many days the market’s been up recently, and the fact that we have key jobs data tomorrow. For the most part, people don’t seem to be making big bullish or bearish bets on stocks or bonds ahead of the employment report. Yesterday’s stock market was about as thrilling as watching gray paint dry, with stocks retreating a bit late in the day after coming within range of all-time highs early on. It’s proving tough for the major indices to get back to previous peaks as the market continues to trade in a tight range. Later today we have a few earnings to watch, including Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Slack (NYSE: WORK). These represent a variety of industries and a lot of interesting individual stories, but there’s really no overriding theme.  As we noted yesterday, the average Wall Street analyst estimate is that around 700,000 jobs were created in May. But that’s not the full story. April’s 266,000 new jobs was way below expectations, which may have been due to timing issues in the collection of the data, so check the bottom part of Friday morning’s Labor Department press release to see if the government revises that upward. Many analysts think it will. Also, if the headline number for May is as high as 800,000 or 900,000—near the high end of the range of Wall Street expectations—that may be something that raises eyebrows at the Fed, where officials are on the lookout for possible signs of economic overheating that could lead to inflation. If we get a big number for May combined with an upward revision to April, keep an eye on Treasury yields for possible upward movement. They’ve done basically nothing so far this week, falling below 1.6% for the 10-year note yesterday. Any move toward the recent high near 1.7% might get some of the “growth” areas of the stock market, like Tech, a bit nervous. The other wild card tomorrow is wages. Some companies say they’re having trouble finding workers to fill openings, and last month’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report showed openings at high levels historically. The May payrolls report could reveal whether employers are dipping into their wallets to pay more for new workers, something that often can drive up prices.  This morning brought a jobs report of its own, the weekly initial jobless claims data. It showed claims dropping to a new post-Covid low of 385,000, down from a revised 405,000 the prior week. It’s interesting to see, but overall just a data point leading into tomorrow’s more important monthly report.  Whatever tomorrow’s employment report says, it’s important not to get too excited one way or another as an investor. One month is never a trend. In fact, since April was weak, even a strong May jobs growth number might not be that conclusive. We might need to see the June data before any trend can be defined. It helps to think in big picture terms when it comes to macro, or else you risk getting caught up in all the weeds. Fed officials recently made a bit more noise about possibly “talking about talking” about a taper of their $120 billion a month bond-buying program as the economy revives. It’s eventually likely to happen. But they’ve also promised a long runway for the market to find out their plans. It seems unlikely that the Fed would announce a taper at either the June or July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, though you can’t completely rule it out. Instead, some analysts say, the Fed’s annual late August Jackson Hole, Wyoming, conference might start getting more of a look. So the market might have a knee-jerk reaction to tomorrow’s data and to next week’s consumer price data for May, but that doesn’t mean the Fed will sense more of a need to change anything. They’re starting to telegraph, but there’s probably a long way to go. It’s not so impressive that U.S. equity markets “timidly tiptoed toward new highs” on Wednesday, to quote research firm CFRA’s Sam Stovall. That’s happened many times already this year and last. What is impressive is how the SPX inched higher without much help from the mega-cap stocks that kept it humming most of the months between last May and early April. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) was down sharply Wednesday, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) barely climbed, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) inched lower. It seems like we talk about these same suspects a lot around here, but there’s a reason for that. The top six SPX stocks by market cap form around 24% of the SPX’s weighted value, so what they do often has an outsized impact. If they’re not performing (and they haven’t been for most of the last two months), it really tells you something when the index can approach new highs without their help. Which leads to the question, where is the current strength originating in the SPX? For that, you don’t have to look too much lower. Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and payment companies Visa (NYSE: V), Mastercard (NYSE: MA), and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL)—all in the top-20 of the SPX by weight—cruised higher Wednesday.  What do they have in common? They’re stocks that tend to do better in a rising economy, where more boats get lifted. By the way, their combined market cap of around $1.5 trillion adds up to well under the market cap of AAPL on its own, which is $2.1 trillion. The combination also comes out below the market caps of either AMZN or MSFT. However, when you have more stocks gaining as the top-weighted ones tread water,  eventually the combined power below can help power things along. That seems to be what’s happening, and arguably it’s a positive thing. Last year, it was the opposite. The so-called FAANG stocks like AAPL and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), with help from TSLA and MSFT, often carried the SPX on their back in a rally dominated by companies geared to outperform with people staying home. This year, it feels like a different sector or group of companies is driving gains every day the SPX goes up, and that’s arguably a healthier situation. When the market relies on just a handful of mega-caps for gains, it can often dive when those companies run into trouble. We saw that back in the fall of 2018 when the SPX fell nearly 20% once the FAANGs lost steam. Without as much FAANG and mega-cap participation this spring, the SPX gains haven’t come as easily. But they’re more widespread, which means there’s the opportunity for investors beyond the names that come immediately to mind. Though the more traditional names accounted for underlying market strength lately, you can’t ignore the fact that “meme” stocks are starting to explode again. The first ones you might think of are AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) and GameStop (NYSE: GME), but now Bed, Bath, & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY) is part of the frenzy. BBBY shares skyrocketed an amazing 62% Wednesday after the company announced the early release of new store brands. However, that kind of climb seemed like a bit of a head-scratcher even with the good news. In contrast, consider that AMZN announced Wednesday its Prime Day will be June 21-22 and the stock barely moved. Last year’s AMZN Prime Day brought $3.5 billion in sales over just two days. BBBY’s revenue for all of its fiscal 2020 was about $9.2 billion, down 17% from the previous year.  Significant levels of “short interest,” or positions that expect the stock would fall, probably helped lead to the big move in BBBY shares yesterday, particularly if the outsize move forced some shorts to cover their positions. In early news today, AMC is floating another 11 million shares. After trading up to $72, shares are pointing down in the mid-$50s. Some of the other big memes are also trading lower in pre-market activity.   CHART OF THE DAY: LUMBER WAKES FROM SLUMBER. For the second time in two weeks, front month lumber futures (/LBSN21—candlestick) bounced viciously off the $1,200 (per 1,000 board feet) level (blue line). In commodities, sometimes the cure for high prices is high prices, but lumber has certainly taken a volatile path after its record run in early 2021. What might that mean for homebuilders ($SPSIHO—purple line)? Data sources: CME Group, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.   How to Approach Memes? Carefully: Many investors may be tempted to jump into the “meme” market action, but memes are likely to continue being volatile and potentially difficult to trade. If you’re thinking of getting in, have a plan for getting out. Also, know what you’re getting into. For instance, consider the valuation of a stock like BBBY (which recorded a fiscal 2020 loss) vs. AMZN. If you’re a long-term investor, you have to decide whether a stock like BBBY or AMC fits your long-term objectives or is just a whim because you hate to miss out. As a final reminder, consider not investing any money in these stocks beyond what you can really afford to lose. Owning them right now isn’t a stroll in the park by any stretch of the imagination. Volatility is elevated, and when it’s elevated, substitute the word “risk” for volatility. Tales From The Lumberyard: After yesterday’s wild price action in lumber futures, we can officially add it to the list of commodities that are hard to pin down these days. For the past couple weeks it’s been looking like that old adage in the commodities market about high prices being the cure for high prices. For lumber traders—and those following the housing market—Wednesday’s 10% price range (see chart above) is a classic case of mixed signals, as the price for those wooden boards has been taking a volatile, meandering path back toward earth after a meteoric rise in early 2021. On the one hand, construction spending—particularly at the residential level—has continued to tick upward. But last month’s housing starts and building permit numbers showed a bit of a pullback from the blistering pace over the past year. And from a macro level, the mixed signal is inflation and, specifically, whether it’s “transitory” or the first leg of a commodity supercycle.  One thing to watch is homebuilders. Any sustained pullback in lumber and other raw material prices, all things equal, would certainly help homebuilders at the margin. But it might also indicate a high-water mark in demand, much of which may have been pulled forward by stimulus, record low rates, and lack of inventory. For what it’s worth, Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL), which reported solid earnings last week, raised its full-year guidance, encouraged by housing market strength and continued low interest rates. Other homebuilder biggies including KB Homes (NYSE: KBH) and Lennar (NYSE: LEN) will release earnings in the next couple weeks, right around the time when we’ll get fresh readings on new and existing home sales. Meanwhile, the lumber market looks to be in a state of confusion. Stay tuned. Tech Mega-Caps Stay Sluggish: Traditional Tech leaders AAPL and MSFT have really lost steam over the last month, and both are trading well under their 2021 highs. This could reflect a lot of things, and there’s no one answer. Worries about how long AAPL can maintain firm growth in iPhone sales after its recent successful iPhone 12 introduction might play into this, along with ideas that maybe some of the biggest Tech firms have already seen their peak Covid recovery. There’s a sense of “what can you do for me now?” built into some of the stocks that carried the market along for several years.  As Tech marched in place recently, two other sectors appeared to spark more enthusiasm among market participants. Automobile stocks like General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford (NYSE: F) surged amid enthusiasm over electric vehicles, and chip stocks like Nvidia, Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), and Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) cruised higher thanks in part to the global shortage of semiconductor chips. These are some of the stocks that seem to have more momentum going into June than the overall Tech sector. TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only. Member SIPC.

What Happened: While hardware announcements are rare at WWDC, the tech giant could still preview the MR goggles at the event as the product is dependent on developers and also unlikely to cannibalize sales of an existing Apple product, Munster said in an event preview note. WWDC is being held virtually for the second year in the row. The event starts on June 7 and runs through June 11 and will allow more than 1,000 Apple engineers to connect on the software-focused show.  See Also: Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference Is Almost Here: What You Need To Know “The question: is the product even ready to be previewed?” Munster, who runs the research-driven venture capital firm, wrote in a note. The Cupertino, California-based company’s mixed reality headset is expected to be launched in mid-2022 followed by an augmented reality glasses launch by 2025, as per well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. According to Munster, MR goggles will initially be a high-end niche product and broader consumer adoption will follow as developers build mixed and augmented reality applications.  “In our view, mixed and augmented reality is an open-ended opportunity for Apple,” Munster said. “Today, AR/MR headset adoption is so low it’s not even measurable. To change that, when Apple launches the product, the company will need to evangelize it through a comprehensive commerce-at-home strategy that’s currently just beginning.” The company has been moving forward to pair features found in other Apple products such as AssistiveTouch with the headset and is foundational to any headset wearable product, Munster said. Why It Matters: Apple’s Wearables, Home and Accessories unit is its third-largest and includes Airpods and Apple watch among other items. It one of the company's fastest growing segments. While Apple does not break out unit sales of this segment, penetration for Watch and AirPods is expected to reach 35% plus in the longer-term, from 13% and 18%, Munster previously said.

What Happened: The Cupertino, California-based company, known to follow an office-centric culture, said some employees may be asked to work four to five days a week in the office. See also: How To Buy Apple Stock Cook had in December indicated some teams would come back to the office as early as June. Employees will be asked to come into the office on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, with the option of working remotely on Wednesdays and Fridays, according to the letter. Teams that need to work in person will return four to five days a week.  Workers also have the chance to work remotely for up to two weeks a year, “to be closer to family and loved ones, find a change of scenery, manage unexpected travel, or a different reason all your own,” The Verge noted, citing the email.  See Also: Apple To See Revenue Growth Ahead Of Street Expectations Through 2025, Munster Estimates: What You Need To Know Why It Matters: Among tech giants, Apple has a more conservative take on remote work.

Google had in April indicated it could save a whopping $1 billion annually if employees continue to work from home the rest of the year and not travel, book trips and hotels online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Platforms State of the Union is slated for 2 p.m. PDT, at which the company is likely to give insights into new developer tools, technologies and advances across software platforms. More than 200 in-depth sessions will be held providing the know-how and expertise to create innovative apps. The company said videos and transcripts of these will be posted each day. The Apple Developer app, the company said, will let users watch videos at multiple playback speeds and easily copy code directly from the video. The forum will allow more than 1,000 Apple engineers to connect on the Apple Developer Forums. The company will also let any viewer with an Apple ID pose questions and share their thoughts. Apple will run coding and design challenges throughout the week providing a fun and interactive way of getting acquainted with the latest technologies and frameworks.

According to a CNET report, there is a rumor of the AirPods 3 possibly making an appearance at the event. This third generation of AirPods will likely have some of the features of its expensive cousin — the AirPod Pro — and may have a shorter stem, interchangeable tips and a smaller charging case than the AirPod Pro, according to reports. It is unlikely to have active noise cancellation. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a late December note that Apple investors may wish to see the long-rumored Apple AR glasses unveiled at the WWDC.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) lobby group on Wednesday backed the European Union's antitrust case against Apple (AAPL.O) which alleges it distorts competition in the music streaming market. The European Commission filed its first antitrust charges against Apple in April following an initial complaint by the iPhone maker's rival Spotify (SPOT.N). Apple has rejected the EU charges, saying that its App Store enabled Spotify to become the world's largest music subscription service. It has been given 12 weeks to respond to the charges. BEUC said it has been allowed to join as an interested third party in the antitrust regulator's case, which could lead to a hefty fine of as much as 10% of Apple's global turnover and force a change to its business practices.  read more  ""We look forward to working with the Commission to ensure that Europe's consumers have access to a full range of music streaming services without their choices being unfairly restricted or prices being artificially inflated,"" BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said in a statement.

What Happened:  The Apple Car project has been in incubation for a while, and since late last year rumors of Cupertino stepping on the gas pedal have been floating around. Several  potential partners  were reported on, but Apple remained tightlipped about its foray into the crowded EV field. Now it has emerged that the company is facing an altogether different challenge of retaining executives at the self-driving unit. Dave Scott, who was leading the robotics team at the unit, recently quit rto join health care company Hyperfine, Bloomberg reported. Other executives who have left the Apple Car project include Jaime Waydo, who was heading the autonomous car safety and regulation team; and Benjamin Lyon, who was a key member of the original Apple Car team, the report said.  Apple has added to its car team over the past few years, having recruited top  Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) executives and other auto industry veterans, Bloomberg said. Signaling its focus on the project, the company has also moved in key executives who have developed key Apple products. Related Link:  10 Things Apple Investors May Wish For In 2021  Why It's Important:  Apple, which initially set sights on a full-fledged car, is now focusing on developing an underlying self-driving car system. TF Securities' Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had said in December that an Apple Car is unlikely before 2025. ""Due to changes in the EV/self-driving market and Apple's high quality standards, we would not be surprised if Apple Car's launch schedule is postponed to 2028 or later,"" Kuo reportedly said.

Although this success wasn't limited to tech titans as smaller companies such as chip designer AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) as well as social networks Snap (NYSE: SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) also delivered strong results, Big Tech showed it is on the ride of a lifetime as in every minute of the first three months of this year, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft combined sold products and services worth about $2.5 million. Profits before tax for the period came in at $88 billion which translates to more than $1 billion of profit for every working day. But with its latest venture into healthcare, Alphabet could possibly reach even new heights. Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft combined spent $50 billion on their R&D efforts in their 2018 financial years. To give you a better idea, that was equivalent to R&D spending by the whole UK economy, according to the most recent data by Office for National Statistics. Facebook said demand is so high that the average price it charges for ads rose by 30% YoY compared with the start of the pandemic. Alphabet's revenues rose by a third-year thanks to Google's advertising business. Moreover, Alphabet was also helped by fast growth in cloud services under which it offers companies access to data centers, as it thrived during the pandemic-induced home office trend. Although Alphabet has scaled back some of its spending on the so-called ""moonshot"" programs, it is still investing heavily in an effort to push the boundaries of what computers can do. At the same time, it still judged that it had $50 billion lying around to buy back shares. If 2020 has taught us anything, it is the importance of good health and Google didn't waste time to tap into this rapidly accelerating field as it entered into a new venture with the Tennessee-based hospital chain HCA Healthcare. Under the partnership, Google Cloud will work to develop algorithms based on the provided patient records with the aim to improve the efficiency of the provided services as well as patient outcomes. At the moment, the healthcare industry has a ton of electronic medical records that aren't being fully utilized. But harnessing them in any way that generates more empirical data that can be of use to practitioners while diminishing reliance on anecdotal evidence could truly make a difference and help patients. So, if Google can pull this off- it will be a big deal or more precisely, monumental. Tech companies are facing increased regulatory pressures across the globe with Germany, France, and the Netherlands complaining that the EU is not tough enough on Big Tech and called on regulators to make it harder for big tech to rule the world. France fined Google 100 million for breaching rules related to online cookies or in simple words, advertising trackers. Amazon was fined 35 million euros in the same incident in December last year. According to the WSJ, Google has offered to remove the offending technical barriers for competitors to settle the antitrust lawsuit but even if it manages to settle, the tech giant is still likely to pay a fine for its practices till now. Google is also facing similar lawsuits in Texas and a class-action lawsuit over gender-based wage disparity in California. Since Covid-19 started its relentless march across the globe, Big Tech quickly went from a defensive mode in times of uncertainty to impressive growth. It is clear that the digital revolution is here to stay, and whether regulators like it or not, these businesses have embedded their products and services deeply in our lives. By the looks of it, Big Tech is working hard on deepening the relationship with the world's population even further.

What Happened: Harmony OS will be an open-source operating system like Google Android. Huawei gadgets were barred from updating Google’s Android operating system since August, under a U.S. embargo. The ban also blocked Huawei’s access to Google Mobile Services software package. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF), Xiaomi Corp (OTC: XIACF), and other leading phone makers besides Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) depend on Google’s Android. Huawei’s potential customers could be the Chinese sellers, who account for 57% of the global handset market. Samsung and Microsoft Corp’s (NASDAQ: MSFT) operating system launch met with minimal success due to Google’s dominant market share. Earlier this year, Huawei disclosed plans to install Harmony OS on over 200 million Huawei devices, including smartphones, and over 100 million third-party devices. Why It Matters: Analysts estimate headwinds in the form of a large ecosystem of software developers, large user base to attract developers and convince outside vendors to abandon a successful product. International Business Strategies Inc CEO estimates greater odds against the mass adoption of the Harmony OS. Huawei showcased its Harmony OS at a Dongguan developers conference in 2019. Huawei’s app store AppGallery has 540 million monthly users and 2.7 million developers. Huawei’s Petal Maps replaces Google Maps, while Petal Search replaces the phone’s Google search bar. The new operating system will not restore user access to Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB), YouTube, and Instagram. Some Chinese manufacturers are already running Harmony OS on their smart appliances, including home-appliance giant Midea which is restricted to China. A Canalys analyst expects Huawei to enjoy greater success in Google’s least penetrated markets like Africa. Price action: GOOG shares closed higher by 0.76% at 2,429.81 on Tuesday. © 2021 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

See also: How To Buy Apple Stock The iPhone transaction volume passed the $15.7 million (100 million yuan) mark in just five seconds while it took Xiaomi five minutes to achieve similar numbers.  Rival Alibaba’s Tmall sales on its international channel surpassed last year’s first day sales of the festival in just eight hours, the report said citing data.

Why It Matters: The annual mid-year shopping event is a major draw for both Alibaba and JD as steep discounts and offers help them add billions in revenue. According to the Global Times report, coupons and discounts are even steeper this year and the online platforms are expected to offer subsidies worth RMB 10 billion through the 20-day event. Vendors this year are also live streaming offers to shore up sales. The annual online sales festival will last through June 20. Price Action: Alibaba shares closed 2.58% higher at $219.48 on Tuesday.

What Happened: The Hong Kong-based SCMP went through Apple’s list of suppliers in the 2017-2020 time frame and concluded that one-third of the shortlisted companies were from mainland China. Among the 52 companies on the latest Apple supplier list, 15 are from the mainland with multiple firms based in Shenzhen and others based in eastern Jiangsu province, as per SCMP. See also: How To Buy Apple Stock Mainland names reportedly include Shenzhen-based Everwin Precision Technology, Tianma Microelectronics Co, and Nanping Aluminium. Suppliers based in the U.S. and Taiwan took second and third place respectively in the list with seven companies each shortlisted.  Why It Matters: “China’s mature manufacturing industry still has its attractiveness despite the US-China tensions,” said Will Wong, an analyst at Singapore-based IDC, SCMP reported. See Also: Apple, Tesla Earnings Reports Show An Increasing Reliance On China As A Market Wong said that this should not be construed as Apple shying from diversifying its supply chain and production. The list does not indicate the monetary value of third-party services. Mainland Chinese suppliers generally offer lower value-added manufacturing and materials, while those based in the U.S. and Taiwan provide advanced components and semiconductors, noted SCMP. Apple’s U.S. suppliers span 3M Co (NYSE: MMM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), and Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ: SWKS). The iPhone maker is trying to diversify production to India and Vietnam in an effort to shed reliance on Chinese manufacturing. However, the Tim Cook-led company’s efforts to diversify its supply chain have been stymied recently as India grapples with a deadly second wave of COVID-19.  Apple suppliers Foxconn, better known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd (OTC: HNHPF), and Wistron Corporation’s Indian operations were affected by the raging pandemic.
Price Action: On Tuesday, Apple shares closed nearly 0.3% lower at $124.28 in the regular session and gained almost 0.2% in the after-hours session.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid A court in California on Tuesday dismissed bribery charges against Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) security chief, writing that a key element of the case was ""pure speculation"" by prosecutors and unsupported by evidence. The Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office in November had said a grand jury indicted Apple Chief Security Officer Thomas Moyer and two officers in the Sheriff’s Office. Prosecutors alleged that Moyer had offered to donate iPads to the Sheriff's Office after a 2019 meeting in exchange for help getting concealed-weapons permits for the company's executive protection team. It is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit in California, and county sheriffs have wide discretion over whether to grant them. Judge Eric S. Geffon of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County found on Tuesday that Moyer had been in talks with the Sheriff's Office about permits for more than a year by the time of the 2019 meeting. By then, Geffon wrote, the evidence suggests Moyer believed the permits were already approved and would be issued soon. Geffon said prosecutors erred in alleging that Moyer had any corrupt intent in offering to donate the iPads. “This argument is pure speculation, and is not supported by the evidence presented to the grand jury,"" Geffon wrote. Moreover, Geffon wrote that Moyer's offer to donate the iPads to the Sheriff's Office, rather than any specific officer, and the fact that Moyer followed all of Apple's internal rules for requesting a donation, showed a lack of corrupt intent. Apple said in November that it had already conducted an internal investigation and found no wrongdoing. ""I thank the Court for giving this case such careful consideration, and for allowing me to move forward with my life,"" Moyer said in a statement. ""I also want to thank Apple, my friends and family for their unwavering support.” Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo The European Commission will on Thursday announce plans for a digital identity wallet to allow Europeans to access public and private services, prompted in part by the COVID-19 pandemic which has seen a massive surge in online services. The move also seeks to counter the growing popularity of digital wallets offered by Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google, Thales (TCFP.PA) and financial institutions which critics say could pose privacy and data protection concerns. The digital identity wallet ""can be used anywhere in the EU to identify and authenticate for access to services in the public and private sectors, allowing citizens to control what data is communicated and how it is used"", according to a Commission document reviewed by Reuters. The wallet will also enable qualified electronic signatures that can facilitate political participation, the 73-page document said. The adoption of an electronic wallet could generate as much as 9.6 billion euros ($11.7 billion) in benefits for the EU and create as many as 27,000 jobs over a five-year period, the document said. By reducing emissions related to public services, the e-wallet could also have a positive environmental impact, the document said.

The iPhone maker initially aimed to debut the service in May but encountered problems after uploading shows onto the platform.

Apple's Podcasts have been around for years, offering free shows on a variety of topics. But in April, Apple announced it was introducing a premium podcast service that will enable listeners to support their favorite podcasters. In return, listeners will enjoy an enhanced experience with ad-free listening and access to exclusive content.

“Apple Podcasts is the best place for listeners to discover and enjoy millions of great shows…We’re excited to introduce this powerful new platform to creators around the world,” said Apple’s Internet services head, Eddy Cue.

Apple will let podcast creators set their subscription prices and decide what perks to offer to their listeners. For the opportunity to sell podcast subscriptions on Apple's platform, creators will pay a $19.99 annual fee. Additionally, Apple will take a cut of podcast subscription sales that the creators generate. The company’s commission will be 30% in the first year and 15% in subsequent years.

The premium podcast service will expand Apple’s roster of subscription services, including Apple Music and Apple TV+. The company is increasingly leaning on service sales to drive growth. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks)

Last week, New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu downgraded Apple stock to Sell from Hold, setting a price target of $90 (27.77% downside potential).

The analyst anticipates weak iPhone demand in Fiscal 2022 after record sales in Fiscal 2021.

“We see material downside risk – shipments in the 180-200m range vs. consensus at 234m,” noted Ferragu.

Despite Ferragu's bearish stance, consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 18 Buy, 5 Hold, and 2 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $156.52 implies 25.61% upside potential to the current price.

Apple, Disney, Visa, Verizon and McDonald's were among the bottom performers last month. Some of them could be due for an upside surprise in June. ""Visa stands out to me,"" said Craig Johnson, Piper Sandler chief market technician. ""Here's a stock that has had obviously a tough May. It's corrected right back to the long-term uptrend support line looking back to March of 2020. And from our perspective, we think that these pullbacks should be bought.""  Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwards Visa fell nearly 3% in May. It is down 4% from its April peak and added just 4% this year. ""I'd also just note from a fundamental perspective that with everybody getting out and about again, clearly transactions are going to be up,"" Johnson told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Friday. ""And we'd also seen some commentary that … two-thirds of the people right now are spending the same amount or more than they were spending in 2019 right now, so that should be a good setup."" Johnson sees a good runway ahead for Visa to recapture and even exceed its April all-time high. ""We think upside from here on the shares will be up to about $285, so about 25% upside from here so we'd be a buyer of Visa heading into June,"" said Johnson. Visa closed Friday at $227.30 a share. Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments, highlighted Disney as the Dow dud she believes could bounce in June. ""You have not only 'Cruella' coming out today and online streaming available today as well, with a $30 surcharge, but you have sporting events restarting, and then there are the parks and in mid-June California opens to non-California residents,"" Tengler said in Friday's interview. Disney has underperformed this year, falling more than 1%. It is down 12% from its March record high. ""We like the story, we think it's done nothing for the year, but with the resurgence of the reopening, we think this is a stock that's being underestimated,"" said Tengler.

company,1622512706,Japan Enlists TSMC to Advance Chip Technology – Report,67959126,https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?201203915,AAPL,Nasdaq,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) or TSMC will collaborate with Japanese companies on a government-backed project to advance chipmaking technologies in Japan.

According to Nikkei Asia, Japan’s position in the global semiconductor industry has been declining. In a bid to improve the country’s competitiveness, the government sought TSMC’s help. 

As a result, TSMC will set up a research and development facility in Japan in partnership with the government. It will use that facility to collaborate with more than 20 Japanese companies on semiconductor technology advancements. The participating companies will include Ibiden, Asahi Kasei, Shin-Etsu Chemical, Shibaura Mechatronics, and Nagase.

TSMC will invest about $337 million in the project, which is about half of the project’s cost. The Japanese government will also fund the project. The research facility will be set up at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Ibaraki Prefecture. The project will begin with a trial before entering full operation in 2022.

In addition to helping advance Japan’s chip technology, the Japanese government is also expecting TSMC to set up a manufacturing plant in the country. TSMC is the world’s largest contract chipmaker with customers including Apple (AAPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM). (See TSMC stock analysis on TipRanks)

On April 15, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini reiterated a Sell rating on TSM but raised the price target from $83 to $85, implying 27.57% downside potential. The analyst observed that TSMC’s $100 billion capex plan would drive revenue growth for the next three years, but depreciation and higher operating expenses will weigh on earnings. 

“Strengthening demand environment, in our opinion, is enabling TSM to increase wafer prices across most nodes, though the sustainability of wafer price increase into 2022 and beyond is not clear,” noted Hosseini.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 1 Buy, 2 Hold, and 1 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $83 implies a 29.28% downside potential from the current price.

TSM scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, suggesting the stock is likely to outperform the market.
